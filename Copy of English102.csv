"26|131|""Now fear Allah",and obey me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|132|""Yea",fear Him Who has bestowed on you freely all that ye know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"26|138|""And we are not the ones to receive Pains and Penalties!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26|140|And verily thy Lord is He,the Exalted in Might,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|141|The Thamud (people) rejected the messengers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|142|Behold," their brother Salih said to them: ""Will you not fear (Allah)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|143|""I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|144|""So fear Allah",and obey me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"26|155|He said: ""Here is a she-camel: she has a right of watering",and ye have a right of watering,(severally) on a day appointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|156|""Touch her not with harm"," lest the Penalty of a Great Day seize you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|157|But they ham-strung her: then did they become full of regrets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|158|But the Penalty seized them. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|159|And verily thy Lord is He,the Exalted in Might,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|160|The people of Lut rejected the messengers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"26|168|He said: ""I do detest your doings.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|169|""O my Lord! deliver me and my family from such things as they do!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|170|So We delivered him and his family,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|171|Except an old woman who lingered behind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|172|But the rest We destroyed utterly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|173|We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|174|Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|175|And verily thy Lord is He,the Exalted in Might Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|176|The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|177|Behold," Shu´aib said to them: ""Will ye not fear (Allah)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|178|""I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"26|187|""Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us"," if thou art truthful!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|188|He said: ""My Lord knows best what ye do.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|189|But they rejected him. Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them,and that was the Penalty of a Great Day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|190|Verily in that is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|191|And verily thy Lord is He,the Exalted in Might,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|192|Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|193|With it came down the spirit of Faith and Truth-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|194|To thy heart and mind,that thou mayest admonish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|195|In the perspicuous Arabic tongue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|196|Without doubt it is (announced) in the mystic Books of former peoples.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|197|Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|198|Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|199|And had he recited it to them,they would not have believed in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|200|Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the sinners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|201|They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Penalty;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|202|But the (Penalty) will come to them of a sudden,while they perceive it not;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26|203|Then they will say: ""Shall we be respited?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|204|Do they then ask for Our Penalty to be hastened on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|205|Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|206|Yet there comes to them at length the (Punishment) which they were promised!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|207|It will profit them not that they enjoyed (this life)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|208|Never did We destroy a population,but had its warners -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|209|By way of reminder; and We never are unjust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|210|No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|211|It would neither suit them nor would they be able (to produce it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|212|Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|213|So call not on any other god with Allah,or thou wilt be among those under the Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|214|And admonish thy nearest kinsmen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|215|And lower thy wing to the Believers who follow thee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|216|Then if they disobey thee," say: ""I am free (of responsibility) for what ye do!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|217|And put thy trust on the Exalted in Might,the Merciful,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|218|Who seeth thee standing forth (in prayer),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|219|And thy movements among those who prostrate themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|220|For it is He Who heareth and knoweth all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|221|Shall I inform you,(O people!),on whom it is that the evil ones descend?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|222|They descend on every lying,wicked person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|223|(Into whose ears) they pour hearsay vanities,and most of them are liars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|224|And the Poets,#NAME?,who follow them:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|225|Seest thou not that they wander distracted in every valley?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|226|And that they say what they practise not?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26|227|Except those who believe,work righteousness,engage much in the remembrance of Allah,and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|1|These are verses of the Qur´an,-a book that makes (things) clear;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|2|A guide: and glad tidings for the believers,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|3|Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity,and also have (full) assurance of the hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|4|As to those who believe not in the Hereafter,We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about in distraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|5|Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is (waiting); and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|6|As to thee,the Qur´an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one who is wise and all-knowing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|7|Behold! Moses said to his family: ""I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information",or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel,that ye may warm yourselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|8|But when he came to the (fire)," a voice was heard: ""Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and glory to Allah",the Lord of the worlds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|9|""O Moses! verily",I am Allah,the exalted in might,the wise!....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|10|""Now do thou throw thy rod!"" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord)as if it had been a snake",he turned back in retreat," and retraced not his steps: ""O Moses!"" (it was said)"," ""Fear not: truly",in My presence,those called as messengers have no fear,-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|11|""But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil",truly,I am Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|12|""Now put thy hand into thy bosom"," and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|13|But when Our Signs came to them,that should have opened their eyes," they said: ""This is sorcery manifest!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|14|And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance,though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|15|We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: ""Praise be to Allah"," Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|16|And Solomon was David´s heir. He said: ""O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds"," and on us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest (from Allah.)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|17|And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,#NAME?,and they were all kept in order and ranks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|18|At length,when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants," one of the ants said: ""O ye ants",get into your habitations," lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|19|So he smiled," amused at her speech; and he said: ""O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours",which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents,and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me,by Thy Grace," to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|20|And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: ""Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|21|""I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty",or execute him," unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|22|But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: ""I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed",and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|23|""I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|24|""I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes",and has kept them away from the Path,#NAME?,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|25|""(Kept them away from the Path)",that they should not worship Allah,Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"27|27|(Solomon) said: ""Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|28|""Go thou",with this letter of mine,and deliver it to them: then draw back from them," and (wait to) see what answer they return""...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|29|(The queen) said: ""Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|30|""It is from Solomon",and is (as follows): ´In the name of Allah,Most Gracious,Most Merciful:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|31|""´Be ye not arrogant against me"," but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|32|She said: ""Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|33|They said: ""We are endued with strength"," and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|34|She said: ""Kings",when they enter a country,despoil it,and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|35|""But I am going to send him a present"," and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|36|Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon," he said: ""Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|37|""Go back to them",and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace," and they will feel humbled (indeed).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|38|He said (to his own men): ""Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|39|Said an ´Ifrit," of the Jinns: ""I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose"," and may be trusted.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|40|Said one who had knowledge of the Book: ""I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!"" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him"," he said: ""This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful",truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful,truly my Lord is Free of all Needs," Supreme in Honour !""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|41|He said: ""Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|42|So when she arrived,she was asked," ""Is this thy throne?"" She said"," ""It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this"," and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|43|And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|44|She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it,she thought it was a lake of water,and she (tucked up her skirts)," uncovering her legs. He said: ""This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass."" She said: ""O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam)",with Solomon," to the Lord of the Worlds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|45|We sent (aforetime),to the Thamud,their brother Salih,saying," ""Serve Allah"": But behold",they became two factions quarrelling with each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|46|He said: ""O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness",ye may hope to receive mercy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|47|They said: ""Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee"". He said: ""Your ill omen is with Allah; yea"," ye are a people under trial.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|48|There were in the city nine men of a family,who made mischief in the land,and would not reform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|49|They said: ""Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people",and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): ´We were not present at the slaughter of his people," and we are positively telling the truth.´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|50|They plotted and planned,but We too planned,even while they perceived it not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|51|Then see what was the end of their plot!- this,that We destroyed them and their people,all (of them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|52|Now such were their houses,- in utter ruin,- because they practised wrong-doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|53|And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|54|(We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold,He said to his people," ""Do ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|55|Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay,ye are a people (grossly) ignorant!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|56|But his people gave no other answer but this: they said," ""Drive out the followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|57|But We saved him and his family,except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|58|And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|59|Say: Praise be to Allah,and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for his Message). (Who) is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate (with Him)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|60|Or,Who has created the heavens and the earth,and Who sends you down rain from the sky? Yea,with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them. (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay,they are a people who swerve from justice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|61|Or,Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two bodies of flowing water? (can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay,most of them know not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|62|Or,Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him,and Who relieves its suffering,and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|63|Or,Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea,and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings,going before His Mercy? (Can there be another) god besides Allah?- High is Allah above what they associate with Him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|64|Or,Who originates creation,then repeats it,and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Say," ""Bring forth your argument"," if ye are telling the truth!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|65|Say: None in the heavens or on earth,except Allah,knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|66|Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay,they are in doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay,they are blind thereunto!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|67|The Unbelievers say: ""What! when we become dust",#NAME?,- shall we really be raised (from the dead)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|68|""It is true we were promised this","- we and our fathers before (us): these are nothing but tales of the ancients.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|69|Say: ""Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty (of sin).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|70|But grieve not over them,nor distress thyself because of their plots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|71|They also say: ""When will this promise (come to pass)? (Say) if ye are truthful.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|72|Say: ""It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be (close) in your pursuit!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|73|But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|74|And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as all that they reveal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|75|Nor is there aught of the unseen,in heaven or earth,but is (recorded) in a clear record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|76|Verily this Qur´an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|77|And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|78|Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted in Might,All-Knowing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|79|So put thy trust in Allah: for thou art on (the path of) manifest Truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|80|Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen,nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call,(especially) when they turn back in retreat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|81|Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind,(to prevent them) from straying: only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs,and they will bow in Islam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|82|And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust),we shall produce from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them,for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|83|One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject our Signs,and they shall be kept in ranks,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|84|Until,when they come (before the Judgment-seat)," (Allah) will say: ""Did ye reject My Signs",though ye comprehended them not in knowledge," or what was it ye did?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|85|And the Word will be fulfilled against them,because of their wrong-doing,and they will be unable to speak (in plea).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|86|See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|87|And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens,and those who are on earth,except such as Allah will please (to exempt): and all shall come to His (Presence) as beings conscious of their lowliness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|88|Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah,who disposes of all things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|89|If any do good,good will (accrue) to them therefrom; and they will be secure from terror that Day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|90|And if any do evil," their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: ""Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|91|For me,I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city,Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to Allah´s Will,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27|92|And to rehearse the Qur´an: and if any accept guidance,they do it for the good of their own souls,and if any stray," say: ""I am only a Warner"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27|93|And say: ""Praise be to Allah",Who will soon show you His Signs," so that ye shall know them""; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|1|Ta. Sin. Mim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|2|These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|3|We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth,for people who believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|4|Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections,depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew,but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|5|And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land,to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|6|To establish a firm place for them in the land,and to show Pharaoh,Haman,and their hosts,at their hands,the very things against which they were taking precautions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|7|So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: ""Suckle (thy child)",but when thou hast fears about him,cast him into the river,but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee," and We shall make him one of Our messengers.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|8|Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|9|The wife of Pharaoh said: ""(Here is) joy of the eye",for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us," or we may adopt him as a son."" And they perceived not (what they were doing)!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|10|But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his (case),had We not strengthened her heart (with faith),so that she might remain a (firm) believer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|11|And she said to the sister of (Moses)," ""Follow him"" so she (the sister) watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|12|And we ordained that he refused suck at first," until (His sister came up and) said: ""Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?""...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|13|Thus did We restore him to his mother,that her eye might be comforted,that she might not grieve,and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true: but most of them do not understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|14|When he reached full age,and was firmly established (in life),We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|15|And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting,#NAME?,and the other,of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe," and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: ""This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|16|He prayed: ""O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!"" So (Allah) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving",Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|17|He said: ""O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me"," never shall I be a help to those who sin!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|18|So he saw the morning in the city,looking about,in a state of fear,when behold,the man who had,the day before," sought his help called aloud for his help (again). Moses said to him: ""Thou art truly",it is clear," a quarrelsome fellow!""",,,,,,,,,,
28|19|Then,when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them," that man said: ""O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land"," and not to be one who sets things right!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|20|And there came a man,running," from the furthest end of the City. He said: ""O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee",to slay thee: so get thee away," for I do give thee sincere advice.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|21|He therefore got away therefrom,looking about," in a state of fear. He prayed ""O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|22|Then,when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan," he said: ""I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|23|And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan,he found there a group of men watering (their flocks)," and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: ""What is the matter with you?"" They said: ""We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is a very old man.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|24|So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade," and said:""O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|25|Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him," walking bashfully. She said: ""My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us."" So when he came to him and narrated the story"," he said: ""Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|26|Said one of the (damsels): ""O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty""....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|27|He said: ""I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee",on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years,it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me,indeed,if Allah wills," one of the righteous.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|28|He said: ""Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfil"," let there be no ill-will to me. Be Allah a witness to what we say.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|29|Now when Moses had fulfilled the term,and was travelling with his family," he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: ""Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information",or a burning firebrand," that ye may warm yourselves.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|30|But when he came to the (fire),a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley," from a tree in hallowed ground: ""O Moses! Verily I am Allah",the Lord of the Worlds....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|31|""Now do thou throw thy rod!"" but when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake",he turned back in retreat," and retraced not his steps: O Moses!"" (It was said)"," ""Draw near",and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|32|""Move thy hand into thy bosom",and it will come forth white without stain (or harm)," and draw thy hand close to thy side (to guard) against fear. Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|33|He said: ""O my Lord! I have slain a man among them",and I fear lest they slay me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|34|""And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper"," to confirm (and strengthen) me: for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|35|He said: ""We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother",and invest you both with authority,so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our Sign shall ye triumph,"- you two as well as those who follow you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|36|When Moses came to them with Our clear signs," they said: ""This is nothing but sorcery faked up: never did we head the like among our fathers of old!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|37|Moses said: ""My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|38|Pharaoh said: ""O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore",O Haman! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay,and build me a lofty palace,that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned," I think (Moses) is a liar!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|39|And he was arrogant and insolent in the land,beyond reason,- He and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|40|So We seized him and his hosts,and We flung them into the sea: Now behold what was the end of those who did wrong!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|41|And we made them (but) leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|42|in this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the loathed (and despised).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|43|We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations,(to give) Insight to men,and guidance and Mercy,that they might receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|44|Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses,nor wast thou a witness (of those events).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|45|But We raised up (new) generations,and long were the ages that passed over them; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan,rehearsing Our Signs to them; but it is We Who send messengers (with inspiration).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|46|Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when we called (to Moses). Yet (art thou sent) as Mercy from thy Lord,to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|47|If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish),#NAME?," they might say: ""Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger? We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|48|But (now),when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves,they say," ""Why are not (Signs) sent to him"," like those which were sent to Moses?"" Do they not then reject (the Signs) which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: ""Two kinds of sorcery"," each assisting the other!"" And they say: ""For us"," we reject all (such things)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|49|Say: ""Then bring ye a Book from Allah",which is a better guide than either of them,that I may follow it! (do)," if ye are truthful!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|50|But if they hearken not to thee,know that they only follow their own lusts: and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts,devoid of guidance from Allah? for Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|51|Now have We caused the Word to reach them themselves,in order that they may receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|52|Those to whom We sent the Book before this,- they do believe in this (revelation):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|53|And when it is recited to them," they say: ""We believe therein",for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to Allah´s Will) from before this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|54|Twice will they be given their reward,for that they have persevered,that they avert Evil with Good,and that they spend (in charity) out of what We have given them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|55|And when they hear vain talk," they turn away therefrom and say: ""To us our deeds"," and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|56|It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one,whom thou lovest; but Allah guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|57|They say: ""If we were to follow the guidance with thee"," we should be snatched away from our land."" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary",to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|58|And how many populations We destroyed,which exulted in their life (of ease and plenty)! now those habitations of theirs,after them,are deserted,- All but a (miserable) few! and We are their heirs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|59|Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its centre a messenger,rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practise iniquity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|60|The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with Allah is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|61|Are (these two) alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise,and who is going to reach its (fulfilment),and one to whom We have given the good things of this life,but who,on the Day of Judgment,is to be among those brought up (for punishment)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|62|That Day (Allah) will call to them," and say ""Where are my ´partners´?- whom ye imagined (to be such)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|63|Those against whom the charge will be proved," will say: ""Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray"," as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|64|It will be said (to them): ""Call upon your ´partners´ (for help)"" :they will call upon them",but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty (before them); (how they will wish) ´if only they had been open to guidance!´,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|65|That Day (Allah) will call to them," and say: ""What was the answer ye gave to the messengers?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|66|Then the (whole) story that Day will seem obscure to them (like light to the blind) and they will not be able (even) to question each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|67|But any that (in this life) had repented,believed,and worked righteousness,will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|68|Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|69|And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|70|And He is Allah: There is no god but He. To Him be praise,at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command,and to Him shall ye (all) be brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|71|Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment,what god is there other than Allah,who can give you enlightenment? Will ye not then hearken?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|72|Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment,what god is there other than Allah,who can give you a night in which ye can rest? Will ye not then see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|73|It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day,#NAME?,and that ye may seek of his Grace;- and in order that ye may be grateful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|74|The Day that He will call on them," He will say: ""Where are my ´partners´? whom ye imagined (to be such)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|75|And from each people shall We draw a witness," and We shall say: ""Produce your Proof"": then shall they know that the Truth is in Allah (alone)",and the (lies) which they invented will leave them in lurch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|76|Qarun was doubtless,of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men,behold," his people said to him: ""Exult not",for Allah loveth not those who exult (in riches).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|77|""But seek",with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee,the Home of the Hereafter,nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good,as Allah has been good to thee," and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|78|He said: ""This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have."" Did he not know that Allah had destroyed",before him,(whole) generations,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|79|So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his wordly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: ""Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|80|But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: ""Alas for you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain"," save those who steadfastly persevere (in good).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|81|Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against Allah,nor could he defend himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28|82|And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: ""Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it",to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that Allah was gracious to us," He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|83|That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|84|If any does good,the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil,the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|85|Verily He Who ordained the Qur´an for thee," will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: ""My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance"," and who is in manifest error.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|86|And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (Allah´s Message).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|87|And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of Allah after they have been revealed to thee: and invite (men) to thy Lord,and be not of the company of those who join gods with Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28|88|And call not,besides Allah,on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command,and to Him will ye (all) be brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|1|A.L.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|2|Do men think that they will be left alone on saying," ""We believe""",and that they will not be tested?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|3|We did test those before them,and Allah will certainly know those who are true from those who are false.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|4|Do those who practise evil think that they will get the better of Us? Evil is their judgment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|5|For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Allah (in the Hereafter,let them strive); for the term (appointed) by Allah is surely coming and He hears and knows (all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|6|And if any strive (with might and main),they do so for their own souls: for Allah is free of all needs from all creation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|7|Those who believe and work righteous deeds,#NAME?,and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|8|We have enjoined on man kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) thee to join with Me (in worship) anything of which thou hast no knowledge,obey them not. Ye have (all) to return to me,and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|9|And those who believe and work righteous deeds,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|10|Then there are among men such as say," ""We believe in Allah""; but when they suffer affliction in (the cause of) Allah",they treat men´s oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah! And if help comes (to thee) from thy Lord,they are sure to say," ""We have (always) been with you!"" Does not Allah know best all that is in the hearts of all creation?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|11|And Allah most certainly knows those who believe,and as certainly those who are Hypocrites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|12|And the Unbelievers say to those who believe: ""Follow our path"," and we will bear (the consequences) of your faults."" Never in the least will they bear their faults: in fact they are liars!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|13|They will bear their own burdens,and (other) burdens along with their own,and on the Day of Judgments they will be called to account for their falsehoods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|14|We (once) sent Noah to his people,and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty: but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they (persisted in) sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|15|But We saved him and the companions of the Ark,and We made the (Ark) a Sign for all peoples!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|16|And (We also saved) Abraham: behold,he said to his people," ""Serve Allah and fear Him: that will be best for you- If ye understand!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|17|""For ye do worship idols besides Allah",and ye invent falsehood. The things that ye worship besides Allah have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from Allah,serve Him,and be grateful to Him: to Him will be your return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|18|""And if ye reject (the Message)"," so did generations before you: and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly (and clearly).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|19|See they not how Allah originates creation,then repeats it: truly that is easy for Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|20|Say: ""Travel through the earth and see how Allah did originate creation; so will Allah produce a later creation: for Allah has power over all things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|21|""He punishes whom He pleases",and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases,and towards Him are ye turned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|22|""Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able (fleeing) to frustrate (his Plan)",nor have ye,besides Allah," any protector or helper.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|23|Those who reject the Signs of Allah and the Meeting with Him (in the Hereafter),#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|24|So naught was the answer of (Abraham´s) people except that they said: ""Slay him or burn him."" But Allah did save him from the Fire. Verily in this are Signs for people who believe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|25|And he said: ""For you",ye have taken (for worship) idols besides Allah,out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life; but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other: and your abode will be the Fire," and ye shall have none to help.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|26|But Lut had faith in Him: He said: ""I will leave home for the sake of my Lord: for He is Exalted in Might"," and Wise.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|27|And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob,and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation,and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|28|And (remember) Lut: behold," he said to his people: ""Ye do commit lewdness",such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|29|""Do ye indeed approach men"," and cut off the highway?- and practise wickedness (even) in your councils?"" But his people gave no answer but this: they said: ""Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|30|He said: ""O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|31|When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news," they said: ""We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are (addicted to) crime.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|32|He said: ""But there is Lut there."" They said: ""Well do we know who is there : we will certainly save him and his following","- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|33|And when Our Messengers came to Lut,he was grieved on their account," and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: ""Fear thou not",nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following,except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|34|""For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven"," because they have been wickedly rebellious.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|35|And We have left thereof an evident Sign,for any people who (care to) understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"29|36|To the Madyan (people) (We sent) their brother Shu´aib. Then he said: ""O my people! serve Allah",and fear the Last Day: nor commit evil on the earth," with intent to do mischief.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|37|But they rejected him: Then the mighty Blast seized them,and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|38|(Remember also) the ´Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them,and kept them back from the Path,though they were gifted with intelligence and skill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|39|(Remember also) Qarun,Pharaoh,and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs,but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|40|Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them," against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them:"" They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|41|The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the spider,who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider´s house;- if they but knew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29|43|And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind,but only those understand them who have knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|44|Allah created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): verily in that is a Sign for those who believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|45|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee,and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And Allah knows the (deeds) that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|46|And dispute ye not with the People of the Book,except with means better (than mere disputation),unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say," ""We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|47|And thus (it is) that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein,as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject our signs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

29|61|If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law),they will certainly reply," ""Allah"". How are they then deluded away (from the truth)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29|62|Allah enlarges the sustenance (which He gives) to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He (similarly) grants by (strict) measure,(as He pleases): for Allah has full knowledge of all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30|6|(It is) the promise of Allah. Never does Allah depart from His promise: but most men understand not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|7|They know but the outer (things) in the life of this world: but of the End of things they are heedless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|8|Do they not reflect in their own minds? Not but for just ends and for a term appointed,did Allah create the heavens and the earth,and all between them: yet are there truly many among men who deny the meeting with their Lord (at the Resurrection)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|9|Do they not travel through the earth,and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs). (Which they rejected,to their own destruction): It was not Allah Who wronged them,but they wronged their own souls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|10|In the long run evil in the extreme will be the End of those who do evil; for that they rejected the Signs of Allah,and held them up to ridicule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|11|It is Allah Who begins (the process of) creation; then repeats it; then shall ye be brought back to Him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|12|On the Day that the Hour will be established,the guilty will be struck dumb with despair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30|13|No intercessor will they have among their ""Partners"" and they will (themselves) reject their ""Partners"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|14|On the Day that the Hour will be established,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|15|Then those who have believed and worked righteous deeds,shall be made happy in a Mead of Delight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|16|And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|17|So (give) glory to Allah,when ye reach eventide and when ye rise in the morning;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|18|Yea,to Him be praise,in the heavens and on earth; and in the late afternoon and when the day begins to decline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|19|It is He Who brings out the living from the dead,and brings out the dead from the living,and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall ye be brought out (from the dead).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|20|Among His Signs in this,that He created you from dust; and then,#NAME?,ye are men scattered (far and wide)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|21|And among His Signs is this,that He created for you mates from among yourselves,that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them,and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|22|And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth,and the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|23|And among His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day,and the quest that ye (make for livelihood) out of His Bounty: verily in that are signs for those who hearken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|24|And among His Signs,He shows you the lightning,by way both of fear and of hope,and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|25|And among His Signs is this,that heaven and earth stand by His Command: then when He calls you,by a single call,from the earth,behold,ye (straightway) come forth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|26|To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|27|It is He Who begins (the process of) creation; then repeats it; and for Him it is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude (we can think of) in the heavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might,full of wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|28|He does propound to you a similitude from your own (experience): do ye have partners among those whom your right hands possess,to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you? Do ye fear them as ye fear each other? Thus do we explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|29|Nay,the wrong-doers (merely) follow their own lusts,being devoid of knowledge. But who will guide those whom Allah leaves astray? To them there will be no helpers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|30|So set thou thy face steadily and truly to the Faith: (establish) Allah´s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|31|Turn ye back in repentance to Him,and fear Him: establish regular prayers,and be not ye among those who join gods with Allah,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|32|Those who split up their Religion,and become (mere) Sects,- each party rejoicing in that which is with itself!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|33|When trouble touches men,they cry to their Lord,turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself,behold,some of them pay part-worship to other god´s besides their Lord,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|34|(As if) to show their ingratitude for the (favours) We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy (your brief day); but soon will ye know (your folly).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|35|Or have We sent down authority to them,which points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|36|When We give men a taste of Mercy,they exult thereat: and when some evil afflicts them because of what their (own) hands have sent forth,behold,they are in despair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|37|See they not that Allah enlarges the provision and restricts it,to whomsoever He pleases? Verily in that are Signs for those who believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|38|So give what is due to kindred,the needy,and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the Countenance,of Allah,and it is they who will prosper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|39|That which ye lay out for increase through the property of (other) people,will have no increase with Allah: but that which ye lay out for charity,seeking the Countenance of Allah,(will increase): it is these who will get a recompense multiplied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|40|It is Allah Who has created you: further," He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Are there any of your (false) ""Partners"" who can do any single one of these things? Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute (to him)!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|41|Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned,that (Allah) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30|42|Say: ""Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before (you): Most of them worshipped others besides Allah.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|43|But set thou thy face to the right Religion before there come from Allah the Day which there is no chance of averting: on that Day shall men be divided (in two).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|44|Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will spread their couch (of repose) for themselves (in heaven):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|45|That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds,out of his Bounty. For He loves not those who reject Faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|46|Among His Signs is this,that He sends the Winds,as heralds of Glad Tidings,giving you a taste of His (Grace and) Mercy,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|47|We did indeed send,before thee,messengers to their (respective) peoples,and they came to them with Clear Signs: then,to those who transgressed,We meted out Retribution: and it was due from Us to aid those who believed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|48|It is Allah Who sends the Winds,and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills,and break them into fragments,until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of his servants as He wills behold,they do rejoice!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|49|Even though,before they received (the rain) - just before this - they were dumb with despair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|50|Then contemplate (O man!) the memorials of Allah´s Mercy!- how He gives life to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who are dead: for He has power over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|51|And if We (but) send a Wind from which they see (their tilth) turn yellow,#NAME?,they become,thereafter,Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|52|So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear,nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call,when they show their backs and turn away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|53|Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thou make to hear,who believe in Our signs and submit (their wills in Islam).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|54|It is Allah Who created you in a state of (helpless) weakness,then gave (you) strength after weakness,then,after strength,gave (you weakness and a hoary head: He creates as He wills,and it is He Who has all knowledge and power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|55|On the Day that the Hour (of Reckoning) will be established,the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30|56|But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: ""Indeed ye did tarry",within Allah´s Decree,to the Day of Resurrection," and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye - ye were not aware!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|57|So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors,nor will they be invited (then) to seek grace (by repentance).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|58|verily We have propounded for men,in this Qur´an every kind of Parable: But if thou bring to them any Sign,the Unbelievers are sure to say," ""Ye do nothing but talk vanities.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|59|Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who understand not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30|60|So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of Allah is true: nor let those shake thy firmness,who have (themselves) no certainty of faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|1|A. L. M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|2|These are Verses of the Wise Book,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|3|A Guide and a Mercy to the Doers of Good,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|4|Those who establish regular Prayer,and give regular Charity,and have (in their hearts) the assurance of the Hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|5|These are on (true) guidance from their Lord: and these are the ones who will prosper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|6|But there are,among men,those who purchase idle tales,without knowledge (or meaning),to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule (on the Path): for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|7|When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one,he turns away in arrogance,as if he heard them not,as if there were deafness in both his ears: announce to him a grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|8|For those who believe and work righteous deeds,there will be Gardens of Bliss,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|9|To dwell therein. The promise of Allah is true: and He is Exalted in Power,Wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|10|He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; He set on the earth mountains standing firm,lest it should shake with you; and He scattered through it beasts of all kinds. We send down rain from the sky,and produce on the earth every kind of noble creature,in pairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|11|Such is the Creation of Allah: now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created: nay,but the Transgressors are in manifest error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|12|we bestowed (in the past) Wisdom on Luqman: ""Show (thy) gratitude to Allah."" Any who is (so) grateful does so to the profit of his own soul: but if any is ungrateful",verily Allah is free of all wants,Worthy of all praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|13|Behold," Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: ""O my son! join not in worship (others) with Allah: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|14|And We have enjoined on man (to be good) to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him,and in years twain was his weaning: (hear the command)," ""Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is (thy final) Goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|15|""But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge",obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice (and consideration),and follow the way of those who turn to me (in love): in the end the return of you all is to Me," and I will tell you the truth (and meaning) of all that ye did.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|16|""O my son!"" (said Luqman)"," ""If there be (but) the weight of a mustard-seed and it were (hidden) in a rock",or (anywhere) in the heavens or on earth,Allah will bring it forth: for Allah understands the finest mysteries,(and) is well-acquainted (with them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|17|""O my son! establish regular prayer",enjoin what is just,and forbid what is wrong: and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee; for this is firmness (of purpose) in (the conduct of) affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|18|""And swell not thy cheek (for pride) at men",nor walk in insolence through the earth; for Allah loveth not any arrogant boaster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31|19|""And be moderate in thy pace"," and lower thy voice; for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|20|Do ye not see that Allah has subjected to your (use) all things in the heavens and on earth,and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure,(both) seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute about Allah,without knowledge and without guidance,and without a Book to enlighten them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|21|When they are told to follow the (Revelation) that Allah has sent down," they say: ""Nay"," we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers (following). ""What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the (Blazing) Fire?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|22|Whoever submits his whole self to Allah,and is a doer of good,has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with Allah rests the End and Decision of (all) affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|23|But if any reject Faith,let not his rejection grieve thee: to Us is their return,and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds: for Allah knows well all that is in (men´s) hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|24|We grant them their pleasure for a little while: in the end shall We drive them to a chastisement unrelenting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|25|If thou ask them,who it is that created the heavens and the earth. They will certainly say," ""Allah"". Say: ""Praise be to Allah!"" But most of them understand not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|26|To Allah belong all things in heaven and earth: verily Allah is He (that is) free of all wants,worthy of all praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|27|And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean (were ink),with seven oceans behind it to add to its (supply),yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted (in the writing): for Allah is Exalted in Power,full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|28|And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for Allah is He Who hears and sees (all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|29|Seest thou not that Allah merges Night into Day and he merges Day into Night; that He has subjected the sun,and the moon (to his Law),each running its course for a term appointed; and that Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|30|That is because Allah is the (only) Reality,and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because Allah,#NAME?,Most Great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|31|Seest thou not that the ships sail through the ocean by the Grace of Allah?- that He may show you of His Signs? Verily in this are Signs for all who constantly persevere and give thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|32|When a wave covers them like the canopy (of clouds),they call to Allah,offering Him sincere devotion. But when He has delivered them safely to land,there are among them those that halt between (right and wrong). But none reject Our Signs except only a perfidious ungrateful (wretch)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|33|O mankind! do your duty to your Lord,and fear (the coming of) a Day when no father can avail aught for his son,nor a son avail aught for his father. Verily,the promise of Allah is true: let not then this present life deceive you,nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31|34|Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). It is He Who sends down rain,and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does any one know what it is that he will earn on the morrow: Nor does any one know in what land he is to die. Verily with Allah is full knowledge and He is acquainted (with all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32|2|(This is) the Revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|3|Or do they say," ""He has forged it""? Nay",it is the Truth from thy Lord,that thou mayest admonish a people to whom no warner has come before thee: in order that they may receive guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|4|It is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth,and all between them,in six Days,and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): ye have none,besides Him,to protect or intercede (for you): will ye not then receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|5|He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up to Him,on a Day,the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|6|Such is He,the Knower of all things,hidden and open,the Exalted (in power),the Merciful;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|7|He Who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|8|And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|9|But He fashioned him in due proportion,and breathed into him something of His spirit. And He gave you (the faculties of) hearing and sight and feeling (and understanding): little thanks do ye give!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"32|10|And they say: ""What! when we lie",hidden and lost,in the earth,shall we indeed be in a Creation renewed? Nay,they deny the Meeting with their Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"32|11|Say: ""The Angel of Death",put in charge of you," will (duly) take your souls: then shall ye be brought back to your Lord.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|12|If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will bend low their heads before their Lord," (saying:) ""Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard: Now then send us back (to the world): we will work righteousness: for we do indeed (now) believe.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|13|If We had so willed,We could certainly have brought every soul its true guidance: but the Word from Me will come true," ""I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32|16|Their limbs do forsake their beds of sleep,the while they call on their Lord,in Fear and Hope: and they spend (in charity) out of the sustenance which We have bestowed on them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|17|Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden (in reserve) for them - as a reward for their (good) deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|18|Is then the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious and wicked? Not equal are they.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|19|For those who believe and do righteous deeds are Gardens as hospitable homes,for their (good) deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32|21|And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this (life) prior to the supreme Penalty,in order that they may (repent and) return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|22|And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the Signs of his Lord,and who then turns away therefrom? Verily from those who transgress We shall exact (due) Retribution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|23|We did indeed aforetime give the Book to Moses: be not then in doubt of its reaching (thee): and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32|25|Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment,in the matters wherein they differ (among themselves),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32|26|Does it not teach them a lesson,how many generations We destroyed before them,in whose dwellings they (now) go to and fro? Verily in that are Signs: Do they not then listen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|2|But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord: for Allah is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|4|Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells (you) the Truth,and He shows the (right) Way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|5|Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah. But if ye know not their father´s (names,call them) your Brothers in faith,or your maulas.

33|6|The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves,and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties,in the Decree of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|7|And remember We took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah,Abraham,Moses,and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|9|O ye who believe! Remember the Grace of Allah,(bestowed) on you,when there came down on you hosts (to overwhelm you): But We sent against them a hurricane and forces that ye saw not: but Allah sees (clearly) all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|10|Behold! they came on you from above you and from below you,and behold,the eyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats,and ye imagined various (vain) thoughts about Allah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|11|In that situation were the Believers tried: they were shaken as by a tremendous shaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"33|12|And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (even) say: ""Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"33|13|Behold! A party among them said: ""Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!"" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet",saying," ""Truly our houses are bare and exposed"," though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away.
33|14|And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the (city), and they had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass, with none but a brief delay!
33|15|And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs, and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.

33|19|Covetous over you. Then when fear comes,thou wilt see them looking to thee,their eyes revolving,like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past,they will smite you with sharp tongues,covetous of goods.

33|20|They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again),they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins,and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst,they would fight but little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|21|Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day,and who engages much in the Praise of Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|22|When the Believers saw the Confederate forces," they said: ""This is what Allah and his Messenger had promised us"," and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true."" And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|25|And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight. And Allah is full of Strength,able to enforce His Will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|26|And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew,and some ye made prisoners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|33|And stay quietly in your houses,and make not a dazzling display,like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer,and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger.

33|34|And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes,of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom: for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|36|It is not fitting for a Believer,man or woman,when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger,he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"33|37|Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: ""Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife"," and fear Allah."" But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people",but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her,with the necessary (formality),We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons,when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah´s command must be fulfilled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|38|There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|39|(It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of Allah,and fear Him,and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call (men) to account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|40|Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,but (he is) the Messenger of Allah,and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|42|And glorify Him morning and evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|45|O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness,a Bearer of Glad Tidings,and Warner,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|46|And as one who invites to Allah´s (grace) by His leave,and as a lamp spreading light.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|47|Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers,that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|48|And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites,and heed not their annoyances,but put thy Trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|49|O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women,and then divorce them before ye have touched them,no period of ´Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|50|O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts,and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts,who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee,and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|51|Thou mayest defer (the turn of) any of them that thou pleasest,and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose (turn) thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes,the prevention of their grief,and their satisfaction - that of all of them - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: and Allah is All-Knowing,Most Forbearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|52|It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this,nor to change them for (other) wives,even though their beauty attract thee,except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enter not the Prophet´s houses,#NAME?,#NAME?,(and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited,enter; and when ye have taken your meal,disperse,without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you,but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want,ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah´s Messenger,or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in Allah´s sight an enormity.,,,,,,,,,

33|56|Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him,and salute him with all respect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|57|Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this World and in the Hereafter,and has prepared for them a humiliating Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|58|And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly,bear (on themselves) a calumny and a glaring sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|59|O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters,and the believing women,that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient,that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|60|Truly,if the Hypocrites,and those in whose hearts is a disease,and those who stir up sedition in the City,desist not,We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33|61|They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found,they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33|72|We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it,being afraid thereof: but man undertook it;- He was indeed unjust and foolish;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"34|10|We bestowed Grace aforetime on David from ourselves: ""O ye Mountains! Sing ye back the Praises of Allah with him! and ye birds (also)! And We made the iron soft for him;-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

34|14|Then,when We decreed (Solomon´s) death,nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth,which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down,the Jinns saw plainly that if they had known the unseen,they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34|15|There was,for Saba,aforetime," a Sign in their home-land - two Gardens to the right and to the left. ""Eat of the Sustenance (provided) by your Lord",and be grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy,and a Lord Oft-Forgiving!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34|16|But they turned away (from Allah),and We sent against them the Flood (released) from the dams," and We converted their two garden (rows) into ""gardens"" producing bitter fruit",and tamarisks,and some few (stunted) Lote-trees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

34|41|They will say," ""Glory to Thee! our (tie) is with Thee - as Protector - not with them. Nay"," but they worshipped the Jinns: most of them believed in them.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34|42|So on that Day no power shall they have over each other,for profit or harm: and We shall say to the wrong-doers," ""Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire","- the which ye were wont to deny!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34|43|When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them,they say," ""This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from the (worship) which your fathers practised.""

34|53|Seeing that they did reject Faith (entirely) before,and that they (continually) cast (slanders) on the unseen from a position far off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34|54|And between them and their desires,is placed a barrier,as was done in the past with their partisans: for they were indeed in suspicious (disquieting) doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|3|O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator,other than Allah,to give you sustenance from heaven or earth? There is no god but He: how then are ye deluded away from the Truth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|4|And if they reject thee,so were messengers rejected before thee: to Allah back for decision all affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|8|Is he,then,to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring,so that he looks upon it as good,(equal to one who is rightly guided)?

35|11|And Allah did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made you in pairs. And no female conceives,or lays down (her load),but with His knowledge.

35|12|Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,#NAME?,sweet,and pleasant to drink,and the other,salt and bitter.

35|13|He merges Night into Day,and he merges Day into Night,and he has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law): each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|14|If ye invoke them,they will not listen to your call,and if they were to listen," they cannot answer your (prayer). On the Day of Judgment they will reject your ""Partnership"". and none",(O man!) can tell thee (the Truth) like the One Who is acquainted with all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|15|O ye men! It is ye that have need of Allah: but Allah is the One Free of all wants,worthy of all praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|16|If He so pleased,He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|17|Nor is that (at all) difficult for Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|18|Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another´s burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other).

35|19|The blind and the seeing are not alike;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|22|Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. Allah can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|23|Thou art no other than a warner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|24|Verily We have sent thee in truth,as a bearer of glad tidings,and as a warner: and there never was a people,without a warner having lived among them (in the past).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35|25|And if they reject thee,so did their predecessors,to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs,Books of dark prophecies,and the Book of Enlightenment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|29|Those who rehearse the Book of Allah,establish regular Prayer,and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them,secretly and openly,hope for a commerce that will never fail:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|31|That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35|33|Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

36|5|It is a Revelation sent down by (Him),the Exalted in Might,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|6|In order that thou mayest admonish a people,whose fathers had received no admonition,and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|7|The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|8|We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins,so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot see).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|9|And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them,and further,We have covered them up; so that they cannot see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|10|The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|11|Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious,unseen: give such a one,therefore,good tidings,of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|12|Verily We shall give life to the dead,and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind,and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|13|Set forth to them,by way of a parable,the (story of) the Companions of the City. Behold!,there came messengers to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|14|When We (first) sent to them two messengers,they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said," ""Truly"," we have been sent on a mission to you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|15|The (people) said: ""Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|16|They said: ""Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|17|""And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|18|The (people) said: ""for us",we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not," we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|19|They said: ""Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished? Nay"," but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|20|Then there came running,from the farthest part of the City,a man,saying," ""O my people! Obey the messengers:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|21|""Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves)",and who have themselves received Guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|22|""It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me",and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|23|""Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me",of no use whatever will be their intercession for me,nor can they deliver me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|24|""I would indeed",if I were to do so,be in manifest Error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|25|""For me",I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen,then," to me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|26|It was said: ""Enter thou the Garden."" He said: ""Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|27|""For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|28|And We sent not down against his People,after him,any hosts from heaven,nor was it needful for Us so to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|29|It was no more than a single mighty Blast,and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|30|Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|31|See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|32|But each one of them all - will be brought before Us (for judgment).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|33|A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life,and produce grain therefrom,of which ye do eat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|34|And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines,and We cause springs to gush forth therein:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|35|That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|36|Glory to Allah,Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces,as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|37|And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day,and behold they are plunged in darkness;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|38|And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him),the Exalted in Might,the All-Knowing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|39|And the Moon,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|40|It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon,nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|41|And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|42|And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|43|If it were Our Will,We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry),nor could they be delivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|44|Except by way of Mercy from Us,and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|45|When they are told," ""Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you",in order that ye may receive Mercy," (they turn back).
36|46|Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom.
36|47|And when they are told, Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you",the Unbelievers say to those who believe: Shall we then feed those whom,if Allah had so willed,He would have fed," (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error.""",,,,,,,,,,,
36|48|Further,they say," ""When will this promise (come to pass)"," if what ye say is true?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|49|They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|50|No (chance) will they then have,by will,to dispose (of their affairs),nor to return to their own people!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|51|The trumpet shall be sounded,when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|52|They will say: ""Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?""... (A voice will say:) ""This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|53|It will be no more than a single Blast,when lo! they will all be brought up before Us!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|54|Then,on that Day,not a soul will be wronged in the least,and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|55|Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|56|They and their associates will be in groves of (cool) shade,reclining on Thrones (of dignity);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|57|(Every) fruit (enjoyment) will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|58|""Peace!"" - a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|59|""And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|60|""Did I not enjoin on you",O ye Children of Adam,that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|61|""And that ye should worship Me",(for that) this was the Straight Way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|62|""But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not",then,understand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|63|""This is the Hell of which ye were (repeatedly) warned!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|64|""Embrace ye the (fire) this Day"," for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|65|That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us,and their feet bear witness,to all that they did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|66|If it had been our Will,We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path,but how could they have seen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|67|And if it had been Our Will,We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about,nor could they have returned (after error).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|68|If We grant long life to any,We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|69|We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry,nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|70|That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive,and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|71|See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the things which Our hands have fashioned - cattle,which are under their dominion?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|72|And that We have subjected them to their (use)? of them some do carry them and some they eat:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|73|And they have (other) profits from them (besides),and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|74|Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah,(hoping) that they might be helped!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|75|They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|76|Let not their speech,then,grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|77|Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|78|And he makes comparisons for Us,and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says," ""Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|79|Say," ""He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|80|""The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree",when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36|81|""Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?"" - Yea",indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme,of skill and knowledge (infinite)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|82|Verily,when He intends a thing,His Command is," ""be""",and it is!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36|83|So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|1|By those who range themselves in ranks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|2|And so are strong in repelling (evil),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|3|And thus proclaim the Message (of Allah)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|4|Verily,verily,your Allah is one!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|5|Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all between them,and Lord of every point at the rising of the sun!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|6|We have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty (in) the stars,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|7|(For beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious evil spirits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|8|(So) they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly but be cast away from every side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|9|Repulsed,for they are under a perpetual penalty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|10|Except such as snatch away something by stealth,and they are pursued by a flaming fire,of piercing brightness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|11|Just ask their opinion: are they the more difficult to create,or the (other) beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|12|Truly dost thou marvel,while they ridicule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|13|And,when they are admonished,pay no heed,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|14|And,when they see a Sign,turn it to mockery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|15|And say," ""This is nothing but evident sorcery!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|16|""What! when we die",and become dust and bones,shall we (then) be raised up (again),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|17|""And also our fathers of old?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|18|Say thou: ""Yea"," and ye shall then be humiliated (on account of your evil).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|19|Then it will be a single (compelling) cry; and behold,they will begin to see!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|20|They will say," ""Ah! Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|21|(A voice will say,") ""This is the Day of Sorting Out"," whose truth ye (once) denied!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|22|""Bring ye up""",it shall be said," ""The wrong-doers and their wives",and the things they worshipped-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|23|""Besides Allah",and lead them to the Way to the (Fierce) Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|24|""But stop them",for they must be asked:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|25|""´What is the matter with you that ye help not each other?´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|26|Nay,but that day they shall submit (to Judgment);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|27|And they will turn to one another,and question one another.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|28|They will say: ""It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand (of power and authority)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|29|They will reply: ""Nay",ye yourselves had no Faith!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|30|""Nor had we any authority over you. Nay",it was ye who were a people in obstinate rebellion!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|31|""So now has been proved true",against us,the word of our Lord that we shall indeed (have to) taste (the punishment of our sins).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|32|""We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|33|Truly,that Day,they will (all) share in the Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|34|Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|35|For they,when they were told that there is no god except Allah,would puff themselves up with Pride,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|36|And say: ""What! shall we give up our gods for the sake of a Poet possessed?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|37|Nay! he has come with the (very) Truth,and he confirms (the Message of) the messengers (before him).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|38|Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|39|But it will be no more than the retribution of (the Evil) that ye have wrought;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|40|But the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|41|For them is a Sustenance determined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|42|Fruits (Delights); and they (shall enjoy) honour and dignity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|43|In Gardens of Felicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|44|Facing each other on Thrones (of Dignity):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|45|Round will be passed to them a Cup from a clear-flowing fountain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|46|Crystal-white,of a taste delicious to those who drink (thereof),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|47|Free from headiness; nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|48|And besides them will be chaste women,restraining their glances,with big eyes (of wonder and beauty).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|49|As if they were (delicate) eggs closely guarded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|50|Then they will turn to one another and question one another.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|51|One of them will start the talk and say: ""I had an intimate companion (on the earth)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|52|""Who used to say",´what! art thou amongst those who bear witness to the Truth (of the Message)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|53|""´When we die and become dust and bones"," shall we indeed receive rewards and punishments?´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|54|(A voice) said: ""Would ye like to look down?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|55|He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|56|He said: ""By Allah! thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|57|""Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord",I should certainly have been among those brought (there)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|58|""Is it (the case) that we shall not die",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|59|""Except our first death"," and that we shall not be punished?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|60|Verily this is the supreme achievement!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|61|For the like of this let all strive,who wish to strive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|62|Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|63|For We have truly made it (as) a trial for the wrong-doers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|64|For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-Fire:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|65|The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|66|Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|67|Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|68|Then shall their return be to the (Blazing) Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|69|Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|70|So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|71|And truly before them,many of the ancients went astray;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|72|But We sent aforetime,among them,(messengers) to admonish them;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|73|Then see what was the end of those who were admonished (but heeded not),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|74|Except the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|75|(In the days of old),Noah cried to Us,and We are the best to hear prayer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|76|And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|77|And made his progeny to endure (on this earth);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|78|And We left (this blessing) for him among generations to come in later times:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|79|""Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|80|Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|81|For he was one of our believing Servants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|82|Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|83|Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|84|Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|85|Behold! he said to his father and to his people," ""What is that which ye worship?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|86|""Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah- that ye desire?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|87|""Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|88|Then did he cast a glance at the Stars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|89|And he said," ""I am indeed sick (at heart)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|90|So they turned away from him,and departed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|91|Then did he turn to their gods and said," ""will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)?...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|92|""What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|93|Then did he turn upon them,striking (them) with the right hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|94|Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps,and faced (him).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|95|He said: ""Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|96|""But Allah has created you and your handwork!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|97|They said," ""Build him a furnace"," and throw him into the blazing fire!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|98|(This failing),they then sought a stratagem against him,but We made them the ones most humiliated!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|99|He said: ""I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|100|""O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|101|So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|102|Then,when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him," he said: ""O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!"" (The son) said: ""O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me"," if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|103|So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah),and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|104|We called out to him ""O Abraham!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|105|""Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!"" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|106|For this was obviously a trial-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|107|And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|108|And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|109|""Peace and salutation to Abraham!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|110|Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|111|For he was one of our believing Servants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|112|And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|113|We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right,and (some) that obviously do wrong,to their own souls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|114|Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|115|And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|116|And We helped them,so they overcame (their troubles);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|117|And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|118|And We guided them to the Straight Way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|119|And We left (this blessing) for them among generations (to come) in later times:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|120|""Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|121|Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|122|For they were two of our believing Servants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|123|So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|124|Behold,he said to his people," ""Will ye not fear (Allah)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|125|""Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators",-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|126|""Allah"," your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|127|But they rejected him,and they will certainly be called up (for punishment),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|128|Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah (among them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|129|And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|130|""Peace and salutation to such as Elias!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|131|Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|132|For he was one of our believing Servants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|133|So also was Lut among those sent (by Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|134|Behold,We delivered him and his adherents,all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|135|Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|136|Then We destroyed the rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|137|Verily,ye pass by their (sites),by day-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|138|And by night: will ye not understand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|139|So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|140|When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|141|He (agreed to) cast lots,and he was condemned:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|142|Then the big Fish did swallow him,and he had done acts worthy of blame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|143|Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|144|He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|145|But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|146|And We caused to grow,over him,a spreading plant of the gourd kind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|147|And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|148|And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|149|Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters,and they have sons?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|150|Or that We created the angels female,and they are witnesses (thereto)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|151|Is it not that they say,from their own invention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|152|""Allah has begotten children""? but they are liars!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|153|Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|154|What is the matter with you? How judge ye?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|155|Will ye not then receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|156|Or have ye an authority manifest?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|157|Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|158|And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment-Seat)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|159|Glory to Allah! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|160|Not (so do) the Servants of Allah,sincere and devoted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|161|For,verily,neither ye nor those ye worship-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|162|Can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"37|166|""And we are verily those who declare (Allah´s) glory!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"37|168|""If only we had had before us a Message from those of old",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37|169|""We should certainly have been Servants of Allah"," sincere (and devoted)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

37|171|Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by Us),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37|172|That they would certainly be assisted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

37|174|So turn thou away from them for a little while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

38|1|Sad: By the Qur´an,Full of Admonition: (This is the Truth).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|2|But the Unbelievers (are steeped) in self-glory and Separatism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|3|How many generations before them did We destroy? In the end they cried (for mercy)- when there was no longer time for being saved!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|4|So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say," ""This is a sorcerer telling lies!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|5|""Has he made the gods (all) into one Allah? Truly this is a wonderful thing!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|6|And the leader among them go away (impatiently),(saying)," ""Walk ye away",and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed (against you)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|7|""We never heard (the like) of this among the people of these latter days: this is nothing but a made-up tale!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|8|""What! has the Message been sent to him - (Of all persons) among us?""...but they are in doubt concerning My (Own) Message! Nay",they have not yet tasted My Punishment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|9|Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord,#NAME?,the Grantor of Bounties without measure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|10|Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between? If so,let them mount up with the ropes and means (to reach that end)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|11|But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|12|Before them (were many who) rejected messengers,#NAME?,and ´Ad,and Pharaoh,the Lord of Stakes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|13|And Thamud,and the people of Lut,and the Companions of the Wood; - such were the Confederates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|14|Not one (of them) but rejected the messengers,but My punishment came justly and inevitably (on them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|15|These (today) only wait for a single mighty Blast,which (when it comes) will brook no delay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|16|They say: ""Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence (even) before the Day of Account!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|17|Have patience at what they say,and remember our servant David,the man of strength: for he ever turned (to Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|18|It was We that made the hills declare,in unison with him,Our Praises,at eventide and at break of day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|19|And the birds gathered (in assemblies): all with him did turn (to Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|20|We strengthened his kingdom,and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|21|Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold,they climbed over the wall of the private chamber;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|22|When they entered the presence of David,and he was terrified of them," they said: ""Fear not: we are two disputants",one of whom has wronged the other: Decide now between us with truth,and treat us not with injustice,but guide us to the even Path..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|23|""This man is my brother: He has nine and ninety ewes",and I have (but) one: Yet he says,´commit her to my care,"´ and is (moreover) harsh to me in speech.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|24|(David) said: ""He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single) ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness"," and how few are they?""...and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord",fell down,bowing (in prostration),and turned (to Allah in repentance).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|25|So We forgave him this (lapse): he enjoyed,indeed,a Near Approach to Us,and a beautiful place of (Final) Return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|26|O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between men in truth (and justice): Nor follow thou the lusts (of thy heart),for they will mislead thee from the Path of Allah: for those who wander astray from the Path of Allah,is a Penalty Grievous,for that they forget the Day of Account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|27|Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! that were the thought of Unbelievers! but woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire (of Hell)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|28|Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness,the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil,the same as those who turn aside from the right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|29|(Here is) a Book which We have sent down unto thee,full of blessings,that they may mediate on its Signs,and that men of understanding may receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|30|To David We gave Solomon (for a son),- How excellent in Our service! Ever did he turn (to Us)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|31|Behold,there were brought before him,at eventide coursers of the highest breeding,and swift of foot;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|32|And he said," ""Truly do I love the love of good",with a view to the glory of my Lord,"- until (the sun) was hidden in the veil (of night):
38|33|Bring them back to me."" then began he to pass his hand over (their) legs and their necks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|34|And We did try Solomon: We placed on his throne a body (without life); but he did turn (to Us in true devotion):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|35|He said," ""O my Lord! Forgive me",and grant me a kingdom which,(it may be),suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|36|Then We subjected the wind to his power,to flow gently to his order,Whithersoever he willed,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|37|As also the evil ones,(including) every kind of builder and diver,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|38|As also others bound together in fetters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|39|""Such are Our Bounties: whether thou bestow them (on others) or withhold them"," no account will be asked.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|40|And he enjoyed,indeed,a Near Approach to Us,and a beautiful Place of (Final) Return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|41|Commemorate Our Servant Job. Behold he cried to his Lord: ""The Evil One has afflicted me with distress and suffering!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|42|(The command was given:) ""Strike with thy foot: here is (water) wherein to wash",cool and refreshing," and (water) to drink.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|43|And We gave him (back) his people,and doubled their number,#NAME?,and a thing for commemoration,for all who have Understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|44|""And take in thy hand a little grass"," and strike therewith: and break not (thy oath)."" Truly We found him full of patience and constancy. How excellent in Our service! ever did he turn (to Us)!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|45|And commemorate Our Servants Abraham,Isaac,and Jacob,possessors of Power and Vision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|46|Verily We did choose them for a special (purpose)- proclaiming the Message of the Hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|47|They were,in Our sight,truly,of the company of the Elect and the Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|48|And commemorate Isma´il,Elisha,and Zul-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company of the Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|49|This is a Message (of admonition): and verily,for the righteous,is a beautiful Place of (Final) Return,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|50|Gardens of Eternity,whose doors will (ever) be open to them;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|51|Therein will they recline (at ease): Therein can they call (at pleasure) for fruit in abundance,and (delicious) drink;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|52|And beside them will be chaste women restraining their glances,(companions) of equal age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|53|Such is the Promise made,to you for the Day of Account!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|54|Truly such will be Our Bounty (to you); it will never fail;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|55|Yea,such! but - for the wrong-doers will be an evil place of (Final) Return!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|56|Hell!- they will burn therein,- an evil bed (indeed,to lie on)!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|57|Yea,such! - then shall they taste it,#NAME?,and a fluid dark,murky,intensely cold!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|58|And other Penalties of a similar kind,to match them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|59|Here is a troop rushing headlong with you! No welcome for them! truly,they shall burn in the Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|60|(The followers shall cry to the misleaders:) ""Nay"," ye (too)! No welcome for you! It is ye who have brought this upon us! Now evil is (this) place to stay in!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|61|They will say: ""Our Lord! whoever brought this upon us","- Add to him a double Penalty in the Fire!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|62|And they will say: ""What has happened to us that we see not men whom we used to number among the bad ones?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|63|""Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule"," or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|64|Truly that is just and fitting,- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|65|Say: ""Truly am I a Warner: no god is there but the one Allah",Supreme and Irresistible,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|66|""The Lord of the heavens and the earth",and all between,#NAME?,able to enforce His Will," forgiving again and again.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|67|Say: ""That is a Message Supreme (above all)",-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|68|""From which ye do turn away!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|69|""No knowledge have I of the Chiefs on high",when they discuss (matters) among themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|70|´Only this has been revealed to me: that I am to give warning plainly and publicly.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"38|72|""When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit"," fall ye down in obeisance unto him.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|73|So the angels prostrated themselves,all of them together:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38|74|Not so Iblis: he was haughty,and became one of those who reject Faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|75|(Allah) said: ""O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|76|(Iblis) said: ""I am better than he: thou createdst me from fire"," and him thou createdst from clay.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|77|(Allah) said: ""Then get thee out from here: for thou art rejected",accursed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|78|""And My curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|79|(Iblis) said: ""O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|80|(Allah) said: ""Respite then is granted thee-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|81|""Till the Day of the Time Appointed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|82|(Iblis) said: ""Then",by Thy power,I will put them all in the wrong,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|83|""Except Thy Servants amongst them"," sincere and purified (by Thy Grace).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|84|(Allah) said: ""Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|85|""That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee","- every one.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|86|Say: ""No reward do I ask of you for this (Qur´an)",nor am I a pretender.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|87|""This is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"38|88|""And ye shall certainly know the truth of it (all) after a while.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|1|The revelation of this Book is from Allah,the Exalted in Power,full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|2|Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve Allah,offering Him sincere devotion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|3|Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than Allah (say): ""We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah."" Truly Allah will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|4|Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son,He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above such things.) He is Allah,the One,the Irresistible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|5|He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day,and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|6|He created you (all) from a single person: then created,of like nature,his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you,in the wombs of your mothers,in stages,one after another,in three veils of darkness. such is Allah,your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion. There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Centre)?,,,,,,,,,,,
39|7|If ye reject (Allah),Truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh not ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful,He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end,to your Lord is your Return,when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in this life). for He knoweth well all that is in (men´s) hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|8|When some trouble toucheth man,he crieth unto his Lord,turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself,(man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before,and he doth set up rivals unto Allah,thus misleading others from Allah´s Path. Say," ""Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire!""",,,,,,,,,,,,
39|9|Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration),who takes heed of the Hereafter," and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: ""Are those equal",those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|10|Say: ""O ye my servants who believe! Fear your Lord"," good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world. Spacious is Allah´s earth! those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without measure!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|11|Say: ""Verily",I am commanded to serve Allah with sincere devotion;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|12|""And I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|13|Say: ""I would",if I disobeyed my Lord," indeed have fear of the Penalty of a Mighty Day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|14|Say: ""It is Allah I serve",with my sincere (and exclusive) devotion:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|15|""Serve ye what ye will besides him."" Say: ""Truly",those in loss are those who lose their own souls and their People on the Day of Judgment: Ah! that is indeed the (real and) evident Loss!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|16|They shall have Layers of Fire above them," and Layers (of Fire) below them: with this doth Allah warn off his servants: ""O My Servants! then fear ye Me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|17|Those who eschew Evil,#NAME?,#NAME?,#NAME?,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|18|Those who listen to the Word,and follow the best (meaning) in it: those are the ones whom Allah has guided,and those are the ones endued with understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|19|Is,then,one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due (equal to one who eschews Evil)? Wouldst thou,then,deliver one (who is) in the Fire?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|20|But it is for those who fear their Lord. That lofty mansions,one above another,have been built: beneath them flow rivers (of delight): (such is) the Promise of Allah: never doth Allah fail in (His) promise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|21|Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky,and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow,therewith,produce of various colours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly,in this,is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|22|Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam,so that he has received Enlightenment from Allah,(no better than one hard-hearted)? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of Allah! they are manifestly wandering (in error)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|23|Allah has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book,consistent with itself,(yet) repeating (its teaching in various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of Allah´s praises. Such is the guidance of Allah: He guides therewith whom He pleases,but such as Allah leaves to stray,can have none to guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|24|Is,then,one who has to fear the brunt of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment (and receive it) on his face," (like one guarded therefrom)? It will be said to the wrong-doers: ""Taste ye (the fruits of) what ye earned!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|25|Those before them (also) rejected (revelation),and so the Punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|26|So Allah gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life,but greater is the punishment of the Hereafter,if they only knew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|27|We have put forth for men,in this Qur´an every kind of Parable,in order that they may receive admonition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|28|(It is) a Qur´an in Arabic,without any crookedness (therein): in order that they may guard against Evil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|29|Allah puts forth a Parable a man belonging to many partners at variance with each other,and a man belonging entirely to one master: are those two equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! but most of them have no knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|30|Truly thou wilt die (one day),and truly they (too) will die (one day).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|31|In the end will ye (all),on the Day of Judgment,settle your disputes in the presence of your Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|32|Who,then,doth more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning Allah,and rejects the Truth when it comes to him; is there not in Hell an abode for blasphemers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|33|And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms (and supports) it - such are the men who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|34|They shall have all that they wish for,in the presence of their Lord: such is the reward of those who do good:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|35|So that Allah will turn off from them (even) the worst in their deeds and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|36|Is not Allah enough for his Servant? But they try to frighten thee with other (gods) besides Him! for such as Allah leaves to stray,there can be no guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|37|And such as Allah doth guide there can be none to lead astray. Is not Allah Exalted in Power,(Able to enforce His Will),Lord of Retribution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|38|If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth,they would be sure to say," ""Allah"". Say: ""See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides Allah",#NAME?,if Allah wills some Penalty for me,remove His Penalty?- Or if He wills some Grace for me," can they keep back his Grace?"" Say: ""Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|39|Say: ""O my People! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): but soon will ye know-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|40|""Who it is to whom comes a Penalty of ignominy"," and on whom descends a Penalty that abides.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|41|Verily We have revealed the Book to thee in Truth,for (instructing) mankind. He,then,that receives guidance benefits his own soul: but he that strays injures his own soul. Nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|42|It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death; and those that die not (He takes) during their sleep: those on whom He has passed the decree of death,He keeps back (from returning to life),but the rest He sends (to their bodies) for a term appointed verily in this are Signs for those who reflect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|43|What! Do they take for intercessors others besides Allah? Say: ""Even if they have no power whatever and no intelligence?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|44|Say: ""To Allah belongs exclusively (the right to grant) intercession: to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: In the End"," it is to Him that ye shall be brought back.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|45|When Allah,the One and Only,is mentioned,the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust and horror; but when (gods) other than He are mentioned,behold,they are filled with joy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|46|Say: ""O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that is hidden and open! it is Thou that wilt judge between Thy Servants in those matters about which they have differed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|47|Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth,and as much more,(in vain) would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment: but something will confront them from Allah,which they could never have counted upon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|48|For the evils of their Deeds will confront them,and they will be (completely) encircled by that which they used to mock at!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|49|Now,when trouble touches man,he cries to Us: But when We bestow a favour upon him as from Ourselves,he says," ""This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge (I have)!"" Nay",but this is but a trial,but most of them understand not!,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|50|Thus did the (generations) before them say! But all that they did was of no profit to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|51|Nay,the evil results of their Deeds overtook them. And the wrong-doers of this (generation)- the evil results of their Deeds will soon overtake them (too),and they will never be able to frustrate (Our Plan)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|52|Know they not that Allah enlarges the provision or restricts it,for any He pleases? Verily,in this are Signs for those who believe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|53|Say: ""O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah: for Allah forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving",Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|54|""Turn ye to our Lord (in repentance) and bow to His (Will)",before the Penalty comes on you: after that ye shall not be helped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|55|""And follow the best of (the courses) revealed to you from your Lord",before the Penalty comes on you - of a sudden while ye perceive not!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|56|""Lest the soul should (then) say: ´Ah! Woe is me!- In that I neglected (my duty) towards Allah",and was but among those who mocked!´-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|57|""Or (lest) it should say: ´If only Allah had guided me",I should certainly have been among the righteous!´-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|58|""Or (lest) it should say when it (actually) sees the penalty: ´If only I had another chance",I should certainly be among those who do good!´,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|59|""(The reply will be:) ´Nay",but there came to thee my Signs,and thou didst reject them: thou wast Haughty," and became one of those who reject faith!´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|60|On the Day of Judgment wilt thou see those who told lies against Allah;- their faces will be turned black; Is there not in Hell an abode for the Haughty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|61|But Allah will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation: no evil shall touch them,nor shall they grieve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|62|Allah is the Creator of all things,and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|63|To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who reject the Signs of Allah,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39|64|Say: ""Is it some one other than Allah that ye order me to worship"," O ye ignorant ones?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|65|But it has already been revealed to thee,#NAME?,"- ""If thou wert to join (gods with Allah)",truly fruitless will be thy work (in life)," and thou wilt surely be in the ranks of those who lose (all spiritual good)"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|66|Nay,but worship Allah,and be of those who give thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|67|No just estimate have they made of Allah,such as is due to Him: On the Day of Judgment the whole of the earth will be but His handful,and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand: Glory to Him! High is He above the Partners they attribute to Him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|68|The Trumpet will (just) be sounded,when all that are in the heavens and on earth will swoon,except such as it will please Allah (to exempt). Then will a second one be sounded,when,behold,they will be standing and looking on!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|69|And the Earth will shine with the Glory of its Lord: the Record (of Deeds) will be placed (open); the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward and a just decision pronounced between them; and they will not be wronged (in the least).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|70|And to every soul will be paid in full (the fruit) of its Deeds; and (Allah) knoweth best all that they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39|71|The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowd: until,when they arrive,there,its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say," ""Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves",rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord," and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?""

40|5|But (there were people) before them,who denied (the Signs),#NAME?,and the Confederates (of Evil) after them; and every People plotted against their prophet,to seize him,and disputed by means of vanities,therewith to condemn the Truth; but it was I that seized them! and how (terrible) was My Requital!,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|6|Thus was the Decree of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers; that truly they are Companions of the Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"40|7|Those who sustain the Throne (of Allah) and those around it Sing Glory and Praise to their Lord; believe in Him; and implore Forgiveness for those who believe: ""Our Lord!

40|22|That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs),but they rejected them: So Allah called them to account: for He is Full of Strength,Strict in Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"40|29|""O my People! Yours is the dominion this day: Ye have the upper hand in the land: but who will help us from the Punishment of Allah"," should it befall us?"" Pharaoh said: ""I but point out to you that which I see (myself); Nor do I guide you but to the Path of Right!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"40|74|""In derogation of Allah?"" They will reply: ""They have left us in the lurch: Nay",we invoked not,of old," anything (that had real existence)."" Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"40|75|""That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth",and that ye were wont to be insolent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"40|76|""Enter ye the gates of Hell"," to dwell therein: and evil is (this) abode of the arrogant!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|77|So persevere in patience; for the Promise of Allah is true: and whether We show thee (in this life) some part of what We promise them,#NAME?,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|78|We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee,and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah: but when the Command of Allah issued,the matter was decided in truth and justice,and there perished,there and then those who stood on Falsehoods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|79|It is Allah Who made cattle for you,that ye may use some for riding and some for food;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

40|81|And He shows you (always) His Signs: then which of the Signs of Allah will ye deny?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|82|Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces (they have left) in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|83|For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs,they exulted in such knowledge (and skill) as they had; but that very (Wrath) at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|84|But when they saw Our Punishment," they said: ""We believe in Allah","- the one Allah - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40|85|But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (Such has been) Allah´s Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of Allah perish (utterly)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

41|2|A Revelation from (Allah),Most Gracious,Most Merciful;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|3|A Book,whereof the verses are explained in detail;- a Qur´an in Arabic,for people who understand;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"41|6|Say thou: ""I am but a man like you: It is revealed to me by Inspiration",that your Allah is one Allah: so stand true to Him," and ask for His Forgiveness."" And woe to those who join gods with Allah",-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|7|Those who practise not regular Charity,and who even deny the Hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|8|For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness is a reward that will never fail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|9|Say: Is it that ye deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? And do ye join equals with Him? He is the Lord of (all) the Worlds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|10|He set on the (earth),mountains standing firm,high above it,and bestowed blessings on the earth,and measure therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion,in four Days,in accordance with (the needs of) those who seek (Sustenance).,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|11|Moreover He comprehended in His design the sky," and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: ""Come ye together"," willingly or unwillingly."" They said: ""We do come (together)"," in willing obedience.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|12|So He completed them as seven firmaments in two Days,and He assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights,and (provided it) with guard. Such is the Decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might,Full of Knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|13|But if they turn away," say thou: ""I have warned you of a stunning Punishment (as of thunder and lightning) like that which (overtook) the ´Ad and the Thamud!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|14|Behold,the messengers came to them,from before them and behind them," (preaching): ""Serve none but Allah."" They said"," ""If our Lord had so pleased"," He would certainly have sent down angels (to preach). Now we reject your mission (altogether).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|15|Now the ´Ad behaved arrogantly through the land,against (all) truth and reason," and said: ""Who is superior to us in strength?"" What! did they not see that Allah",Who created them,was superior to them in strength? But they continued to reject Our Signs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|16|So We sent against them a furious Wind through days of disaster,that We might give them a taste of a Penalty of humiliation in this life; but the Penalty of a Hereafter will be more humiliating still: and they will find no help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|17|As to the Thamud,We gave them Guidance,but they preferred blindness (of heart) to Guidance: so the stunning Punishment of humiliation seized them,because of what they had earned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|18|But We delivered those who believed and practised righteousness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|19|On the Day that the enemies of Allah will be gathered together to the Fire,they will be marched in ranks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|20|At length,when they reach the (Fire),their hearing,their sight,and their skins will bear witness against them,as to (all) their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|21|They will say to their skins: ""Why bear ye witness against us?"" They will say: ""Allah hath given us speech",#NAME?,and unto Him were ye to return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|22|""Ye did not seek to hide yourselves",lest your hearing,your sight,and your skins should bear witness against you! But ye did think that Allah knew not many of the things that ye used to do!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|23|""But this thought of yours which ye did entertain concerning your Lord",hath brought you to destruction," and (now) have ye become of those utterly lost!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|24|If,then,they have patience,the Fire will be a home for them! and if they beg to be received into favour,into favour will they not (then) be received.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|25|And We have destined for them intimate companions (of like nature),who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men,who have passed away,is proved against them; for they are utterly lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|26|The Unbelievers say: ""Listen not to this Qur´an",but talk at random in the midst of its (reading)," that ye may gain the upper hand!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|27|But We will certainly give the Unbelievers a taste of a severe Penalty,and We will requite them for the worst of their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|28|Such is the requital of the enemies of Allah,#NAME?,for that they were wont to reject Our Signs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|29|And the Unbelievers will say: ""Our Lord! Show us those",among Jinns and men,who misled us: We shall crush them beneath our feet," so that they become the vilest (before all).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|30|In the case of those who say," ""Our Lord is Allah""",and,further,stand straight and steadfast," the angels descend on them (from time to time): ""Fear ye not!"" (they suggest)"," ""Nor grieve! but receive the Glad Tidings of the Garden (of Bliss)",the which ye were promised!,,,,,,,,,,,

41|33|Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah,works righteousness,and says," ""I am of those who bow in Islam""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|34|Nor can goodness and Evil be equal. Repel (Evil) with what is better: Then will he between whom and thee was hatred become as it were thy friend and intimate!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|35|And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|36|And if (at any time) an incitement to discord is made to thee by the Evil One,seek refuge in Allah. He is the One Who hears and knows all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|37|Among His Signs are the Night and the Day,and the Sun and the Moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and the moon,but prostrate to Allah,Who created them,if it is Him ye wish to serve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|38|But is the (Unbelievers) are arrogant,(no matter): for in the presence of thy Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never flag (nor feel themselves above it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|39|And among His Signs in this: thou seest the earth barren and desolate; but when We send down rain to it,it is stirred to life and yields increase. Truly,He Who gives life to the (dead) earth can surely give life to (men) who are dead. For He has power over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|40|Those who pervert the Truth in Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Which is better?- he that is cast into the Fire,or he that comes safe through,on the Day of Judgment? Do what ye will: verily He seeth (clearly) all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|41|Those who reject the Message when it comes to them (are not hidden from Us). And indeed it is a Book of exalted power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|42|No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is sent down by One Full of Wisdom,Worthy of all Praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|43|Nothing is said to thee that was not said to the messengers before thee: that thy lord has at his Command (all) forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|44|Had We sent this as a Qur´an (in the language) other than Arabic," they would have said: ""Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! (a Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger an Arab?"" Say: ""It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not",there is a deafness in their ears," and it is blindness in their (eyes): They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|45|We certainly gave Moses the Book aforetime: but disputes arose therein. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord,(their differences) would have been settled between them: but they remained in suspicious disquieting doubt thereon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|46|Whoever works righteousness benefits his own soul; whoever works evil,it is against his own soul: nor is thy Lord ever unjust (in the least) to His Servants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|47|To Him is referred the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment: He knows all): No date-fruit comes out of its sheath,nor does a female conceive (within her womb) nor bring forth the Day that (Allah) will propound to them the (question)," ""Where are the partners (ye attributed to Me?"" They will say"," ""We do assure thee not one of us can bear witness!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|48|The (deities) they used to invoke aforetime will leave them in the lurch,and they will perceive that they have no way of escape.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|49|Man does not weary of asking for good (things),but if ill touches him,he gives up all hope (and) is lost in despair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|50|When we give him a taste of some Mercy from Ourselves,after some adversity has touched him,he is sure to say," ""This is due to my (merit): I think not that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) be established; but if I am brought back to my Lord"," I have (much) good (stored) in His sight!"" But We will show the Unbelievers the truth of all that they did",and We shall give them the taste of a severe Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|51|When We bestow favours on man,he turns away,and gets himself remote on his side (instead of coming to Us); and when evil seizes him,(he comes) full of prolonged prayer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"41|52|Say: ""See ye if the (Revelation) is (really) from Allah"," and yet do ye reject it? Who is more astray than one who is in a schism far (from any purpose)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41|53|Soon will We show them our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth),and in their own souls,until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord doth witness all things?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

42|10|Whatever it be wherein ye differ,the decision thereof is with Allah: such is Allah my Lord: In Him I trust,and to Him I turn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|11|(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves,and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him,and He is the One that hears and sees (all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|12|To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|13|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham,Moses,and Jesus: Namely,that ye should remain steadfast in religion,and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah,hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases,and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|14|And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,#NAME?,(tending) to a Term appointed,the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|15|Now then,for that (reason),call (them to the Faith),and stand steadfast as thou art commanded," nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: ""I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the responsibility for) our deeds",and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us together,and to Him is (our) Final Goal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|16|But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|17|It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth,and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|18|Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe hold it in awe,and know that it is the Truth. Behold,verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|19|Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases: and He has power and can carry out His Will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|20|To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter,We give increase in his tilth,and to any that desires the tilth of this world,We grant somewhat thereof,but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|21|What! have they partners (in godhead),who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment,the matter would have been decided between them (at once). But verily the Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|22|Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned,and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have,before their Lord,all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"42|23|That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: ""No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin."" And if any one earns any good",We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Ready to appreciate (service).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|24|What! Do they say," ""He has forged a falsehood against Allah""? But if Allah willed",He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Vanity,and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|25|He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|26|And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness,and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|27|If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants,they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted,Watchful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|28|He is the One that sends down rain (even) after (men) have given up all hope,and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the Protector,Worthy of all Praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|29|And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth,and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|30|Whatever misfortune happens to you,is because on the things your hands have wrought,and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|31|Nor can ye frustrate (aught),(fleeing) through the earth; nor have ye,besides Allah,any one to protect or to help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|32|And among His Signs are the ships,smooth-running through the ocean,(tall) as mountains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|33|If it be His Will He can still the Wind: then would they become motionless on the back of the (ocean). Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|34|Or He can cause them to perish because of the (evil) which (the men) have earned; but much doth He forgive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|35|But let those know,who dispute about Our Signs,that there is for them no way of escape.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|36|Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|37|Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds,and,when they are angry even then forgive;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|38|Those who hearken to their Lord,and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|39|And those who,when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them,(are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|40|The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation,his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|41|But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them,against such there is no cause of blame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|42|The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land,defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|43|But indeed if any show patience and forgive,that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|44|For any whom Allah leaves astray,there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers,when in sight of the Penalty," Say: ""Is there any way (to effect) a return?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|45|And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty),in a humble frame of mind because of (their) disgrace," (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: ""Those are indeed in loss"," who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|46|And no protectors have they to help them,other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray,there is no way (to the Goal).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|47|Hearken ye to your Lord,before there come a Day which there will be no putting back,because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|48|If then they run away,We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly,when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves,he doth exult thereat,but when some ill happens to him,on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth,truly then is man ungrateful!,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|49|To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|50|Or He bestows both males and females,and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|51|It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration,or from behind a veil,or by the sending of a messenger to reveal,with Allah´s permission,what Allah wills: for He is Most High,Most Wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|52|And thus have We,by Our Command,sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation,and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qur´an) a Light,wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost guide (men) to the Straight Way,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42|53|The Way of Allah,to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold (how) all affairs tend towards Allah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|1|Ha-Mim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|2|By the Book that makes things clear,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|3|We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic,that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|4|And verily,it is in the Mother of the Book,in Our Presence,high (in dignity),full of wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|5|Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel (you),for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|6|But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|7|And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|8|So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|9|If thou wert to question them,´Who created the heavens and the earth?´ They would be sure to reply,´they were created by (Him),the Exalted in Power,Full of Knowledge´;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|10|(Yea,the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out,and has made for you roads (and channels) therein,in order that ye may find guidance (on the way);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|11|That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|12|That has created pairs in all things,and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|13|In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs,and when so seated,ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord,and say," ""Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use)",for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves),,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|14|""And to our Lord",surely," must we turn back!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|15|Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|16|What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates,and granted to you sons for choice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|17|When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious,his face darkens,and he is filled with inward grief!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|18|Is then one brought up among trinkets,and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|19|And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded,and they will be called to account!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|20|(""Ah!"") they say"," ""If it had been the will of (Allah) Most Gracious"," we should not have worshipped such (deities)!"" Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|21|What! have We given them a Book before this,to which they are holding fast?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|22|Nay! they say: ""We found our fathers following a certain religion"," and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|23|Just in the same way,whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people," the wealthy ones among them said: ""We found our fathers following a certain religion"," and we will certainly follow in their footsteps.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|24|He said: ""What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following?"" They said: ""For us"," we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|25|So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|26|Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: ""I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|27|""(I worship) only Him Who made me"," and He will certainly guide me.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|28|And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him,that they may turn back (to Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|29|Yea,I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers,until the Truth has come to them,and a messenger making things clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|30|But when the Truth came to them," they said: ""This is sorcery"," and we do reject it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|31|Also," they say: ""Why is not this Qur´an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|32|Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks,so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|33|And were it not that (all) men might become of one (evil) way of life,We would provide,for everyone that blasphemes against (Allah) Most Gracious,silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stair-ways on which to go up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|34|And (silver) doors to their houses,and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|35|And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter,in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|36|If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of (Allah) Most Gracious,We appoint for him an evil one,to be an intimate companion to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|37|Such (evil ones) really hinder them from the Path,but they think that they are being guided aright!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|38|At length,when (such a one) comes to Us," he says (to his evil companion): ""Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!"" Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|39|When ye have done wrong,it will avail you nothing,that Day,that ye shall be partners in Punishment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|40|Canst thou then make the deaf to hear,or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|41|Even if We take thee away,We shall be sure to exact retribution from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|42|Or We shall show thee that (accomplished) which We have promised them: for verily We shall prevail over them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|43|So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|44|The (Qur´an) is indeed the message,for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye (all) be brought to account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|45|And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appoint any deities other than (Allah) Most Gracious,to be worshipped?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|46|We did send Moses aforetime,with Our Signs,to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He said," ""I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|47|But when he came to them with Our Signs,behold they ridiculed them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|48|We showed them Sign after Sign,each greater than its fellow,and We seized them with Punishment,in order that they might turn (to Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|49|And they said," ""O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|50|But when We removed the Penalty from them,behold,they broke their word.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|51|And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people," saying: ""O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me",(witness) these streams flowing underneath my (palace)? What! see ye not then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|52|""Am I not better than this (Moses)",who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|53|""Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him"," or (why) come (not) with him angels accompanying him in procession?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|54|Thus did he make fools of his people,and they obeyed him: truly were they a people rebellious (against Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|55|When at length they provoked Us,We exacted retribution from them,and We drowned them all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|56|And We made them (a people) of the Past and an Example to later ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|57|When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example,behold,thy people raise a clamour thereat (in ridicule)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|58|And they say," ""Are our gods best"," or he?"" This they set forth to thee",only by way of disputation: yea,they are a contentious people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|59|He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favour to him,and We made him an example to the Children of Israel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|60|And if it were Our Will,We could make angels from amongst you,succeeding each other on the earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|61|And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour),but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|62|Let not the Evil One hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|63|When Jesus came with Clear Signs," he said: ""Now have I come to you with Wisdom",and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) on which ye dispute: therefore fear Allah and obey me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|64|""For Allah"," He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship ye Him: this is a Straight Way.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|65|But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to the wrong-doers,from the Penalty of a Grievous Day!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|66|Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden,while they perceive not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|67|Friends on that day will be foes,one to another,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|68|My devotees! no fear shall be on you that Day,nor shall ye grieve,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|69|(Being) those who have believed in Our Signs and bowed (their wills to Ours) in Islam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|70|Enter ye the Garden,ye and your wives,in (beauty and) rejoicing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|71|To them will be passed round,dishes and goblets of gold: there will be there all that the souls could desire,all that their ayes could delight in: and ye shall abide therein (for eye).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|72|Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your (good) deeds (in life).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|73|Ye shall have therein abundance of fruit,from which ye shall have satisfaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|74|The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell,to dwell therein (for aye):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|75|Nowise will the (Punishment) be lightened for them,and in despair will they be there overwhelmed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|76|Nowise shall We be unjust to them: but it is they who have been unjust themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|77|They will cry: ""O Malik! would that thy Lord put an end to us!"" He will say"," ""Nay"," but ye shall abide!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|78|Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred for Truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|79|What! have they settled some plan (among themselves)? But it is We Who settle things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|80|Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed (We do),and Our messengers are by them,to record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"43|81|Say: ""If (Allah) Most Gracious had a son"," I would be the first to worship.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|82|Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth,the Lord of the Throne (of Authority)! (He is free) from the things they attribute (to him)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|83|So leave them to babble and play (with vanities) until they meet that Day of theirs,which they have been promised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|84|It is He Who is Allah in heaven and Allah on earth; and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|85|And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth,and all between them: with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment): and to Him shall ye be brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|86|And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession;- only he who bears witness to the Truth,and they know (him).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|87|If thou ask them,who created them,they will certainly say,Allah: How then are they deluded away (from the Truth)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|88|(Allah has knowledge) of the (Prophet´s) cry," ""O my Lord! Truly these are people who will not believe!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43|89|But turn away from them," and say ""Peace!"" But soon shall they know!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|1|Ha-Mim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|2|By the Book that makes things clear;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|3|We sent it down during a Blessed Night: for We (ever) wish to warn (against Evil).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|4|In the (Night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|5|By command,from Our Presence. For We (ever) send (revelations),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|6|As Mercy from thy Lord: for He hears and knows (all things);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|7|The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them,if ye (but) have an assured faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|8|There is no god but He: It is He Who gives life and gives death,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|9|Yet they play about in doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|10|Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke (or mist) plainly visible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|11|Enveloping the people: this will be a Penalty Grievous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"44|12|(They will say:) ""Our Lord! remove the Penalty from us"," for we do really believe!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|13|How shall the message be (effectual) for them,seeing that an Messenger explaining things clearly has (already) come to them,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"44|14|Yet they turn away from him and say: ""Tutored (by others)"," a man possessed!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|15|We shall indeed remove the Penalty for a while,(but) truly ye will revert (to your ways).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|16|One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught: We will indeed (then) exact Retribution!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|17|We did,before them,try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them a messenger most honourable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"44|18|Saying: ""Restore to me the Servants of Allah: I am to you an messenger worthy of all trust;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"44|24|""And leave the sea as a furrow (divided): for they are a host (destined) to be drowned.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|25|How many were the gardens and springs they left behind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|26|And corn-fields and noble buildings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|27|And wealth (and conveniences of life),wherein they had taken such delight!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|28|Thus (was their end)! And We made other people inherit (those things)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|29|And neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them: nor were they given a respite (again).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|30|We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating Punishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|31|Inflicted by Pharaoh,for he was arrogant (even) among inordinate transgressors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|32|And We chose them aforetime above the nations,knowingly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|33|And granted them Signs in which there was a manifest trial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|34|As to these (Quraish),they say forsooth:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"44|36|""Then bring (back) our forefathers"," if what ye say is true!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|37|What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who were before them? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|38|We created not the heavens,the earth,and all between them,merely in (idle) sport:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|39|We created them not except for just ends: but most of them do not understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|40|Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|41|The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught,and no help can they receive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|42|Except such as receive Allah´s Mercy: for He is Exalted in Might,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|43|Verily the tree of Zaqqum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|44|Will be the food of the Sinful,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|45|Like molten brass; it will boil in their insides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|46|Like the boiling of scalding water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44|53|Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade,they will face each other;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|54|So; and We shall join them to fair women with beautiful,big,and lustrous eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|55|There can they call for every kind of fruit in peace and security;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|56|Nor will they there taste Death,except the first death; and He will preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|57|As a Bounty from thy Lord! that will be the supreme achievement!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44|58|Verily,We have made this (Qur´an) easy,in thy tongue,in order that they may give heed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

45|2|The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power,Full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|3|Verily in the heavens and the earth,are Signs for those who believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|4|And in the creation of yourselves and the fact that animals are scattered (through the earth),are Signs for those of assured Faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|5|And in the alternation of Night and Day,and the fact that Allah sends down Sustenance from the sky,and revives therewith the earth after its death,and in the change of the winds,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|6|Such are the Signs of Allah,which We rehearse to thee in Truth; then in what exposition will they believe after (rejecting) Allah and His Signs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|7|Woe to each sinful dealer in Falsehoods:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|8|He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him,yet is obstinate and lofty,as if he had not heard them: then announce to him a Penalty Grievous!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|9|And when he learns something of Our Signs,he takes them in jest: for such there will be a humiliating Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|10|In front of them is Hell: and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned,nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides Allah: for them is a tremendous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|11|This is (true) Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord,is a grievous Penalty of abomination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|12|It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you,that ships may sail through it by His command,that ye may seek of his Bounty,and that ye may be grateful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|13|And He has subjected to you,as from Him,all that is in the heavens and on earth: Behold,in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|14|Tell those who believe,to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah: It is for Him to recompense (for good or ill) each People according to what they have earned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|15|If any one does a righteous deed,it ensures to the benefit of his own soul; if he does evil,it works against (his own soul). In the end will ye (all) be brought back to your Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|16|We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command,and Prophethood; We gave them,for Sustenance,things good and pure; and We favoured them above the nations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|17|And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs (of Religion): it was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms,through insolent envy among themselves. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those matters in which they set up differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|18|Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way),and follow not the desires of those who know not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|19|They will be of no use to thee in the sight of Allah: it is only Wrong-doers (that stand as) protectors,one to another: but Allah is the Protector of the Righteous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|20|These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured Faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|21|What! Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|22|Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends,and in order that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned,and none of them be wronged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|23|Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire? Allah has,knowing (him as such),left him astray,and sealed his hearing and his heart (and understanding),and put a cover on his sight. Who,then,will guide him after Allah (has withdrawn Guidance)? Will ye not then receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|24|And they say: ""What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and we live"," and nothing but time can destroy us."" But of that they have no knowledge: they merely conjecture:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|25|And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them their argument is nothing but this: They say," ""Bring (back) our forefathers"," if what ye say is true!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|26|Say: ""It is Allah Who gives you life"," then gives you death; then He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt"": But most men do not understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|27|To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth,and the Day that the Hour of Judgment is established,- that Day will the dealers in Falsehood perish!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|28|And thou wilt see every sect bowing the knee: Every sect will be called to its Record: ""This Day shall ye be recompensed for all that ye did!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|29|""This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on Record all that ye did.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|30|Then,as to those who believed and did righteous deeds,their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|31|But as to those who rejected Allah," (to them will be said): ""Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you? But ye were arrogant",and were a people given to sin!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|32|""And when it was said that the promise of Allah was true",and that the Hour- there was no doubt about its (coming),ye used to say,´We know not what is the hour: we only think it is an idea," and we have no firm assurance.´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|33|Then will appear to them the evil (fruits) of what they did,and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|34|It will also be said: ""This Day We will forget you as ye forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! and your abode is the Fire",and no helpers have ye!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"45|35|""This",because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest," and the life of the world deceived you:"" (From) that Day",therefore,they shall not be taken out thence,nor shall they be received into Grace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|36|Then Praise be to Allah,Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth,- Lord and Cherisher of all the Worlds!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45|37|To Him be glory throughout the heavens and the earth: and He is Exalted in Power,Full of Wisdom!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|1|Ha-Mim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|2|The Revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power,Full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|3|We created not the heavens and the earth and all between them but for just ends,and for a Term Appointed: But those who reject Faith turn away from that whereof they are warned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|4|Say: ""Do ye see what it is ye invoke besides Allah? Show me what it is they have created on earth",or have they a share in the heavens bring me a book (revealed) before this,or any remnant of knowledge (ye may have),if ye are telling the truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|5|And who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allah,such as will not answer him to the Day of Judgment,and who (in fact) are unconscious of their call (to them)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|6|And when mankind are gathered together (at the Resurrection),they will be hostile to them and reject their worship (altogether)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|7|When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them,the Unbelievers say," of the Truth when it comes to them: ""This is evident sorcery!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|8|Or do they say," ""He has forged it""? Say: ""Had I forged it",then can ye obtain no single (blessing) for me from Allah. He knows best of that whereof ye talk (so glibly)! Enough is He for a witness between me and you! And he is Oft-Forgiving," Most Merciful.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|9|Say: ""I am no bringer of new-fangled doctrine among the messengers"," nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I follow but that which is revealed to me by inspiration; I am but a Warner open and clear.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|10|Say: ""See ye? If (this teaching) be from Allah",and ye reject it,and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity (with earlier scripture),and has believed while ye are arrogant,(how unjust ye are!) truly," Allah guides not a people unjust.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|11|The Unbelievers say of those who believe: ""If (this Message) were a good thing",(such men) would not have gone to it first," before us!"" And seeing that they guide not themselves thereby",they will say," ""this is an (old",") falsehood!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|12|And before this,was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this Book confirms (it) in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust,and as Glad Tidings to those who do right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|13|Verily those who say," ""Our Lord is Allah"," and remain firm (on that Path),- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
46|14|Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein (for aye): a recompense for their (good) deeds.
46|15|We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the (child) to his weaning is (a period of) thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me",and upon both my parents," and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow (to Thee) in Islam.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|16|Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass by their ill deeds: (They shall be) among the Companions of the Garden: a promise! of truth,which was made to them (in this life).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|17|But (there is one) who says to his parents," ""Fie on you! Do ye hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up"," even though generations have passed before me (without rising again)?"" And they two seek Allah´s aid"," (and rebuke the son): ""Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of Allah is true."" But he says"," ""This is nothing but tales of the ancients!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|18|Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men,that have passed away; for they will be (utterly) lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|19|And to all are (assigned) degrees according to the deeds which they (have done),and in order that (Allah) may recompense their deeds,and no injustice be done to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|20|And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire," (It will be said to them): ""Ye received your good things in the life of the world",and ye took your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed with a Penalty of humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without just cause," and that ye (ever) transgressed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|21|Mention (Hud) one of ´Ad´s (own) brethren: Behold," he warned his people about the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and after him: ""Worship ye none other than Allah: Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Mighty Day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|22|They said: ""Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then bring upon us the (calamity) with which thou dost threaten us"," if thou art telling the truth?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|23|He said: ""The Knowledge (of when it will come) is only with Allah: I proclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that ye are a people in ignorance!""..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|24|Then,when they saw the (Penalty in the shape of) a cloud traversing the sky,coming to meet their valleys,they said," ""This cloud will give us rain!"" ""Nay",it is the (Calamity) ye were asking to be hastened!- A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|25|""Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!"" Then by the morning they - nothing was to be seen but (the ruins of) their houses! thus do We recompense those given to sin!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|26|And We had firmly established them in a (prosperity and) power which We have not given to you (ye Quraish!) and We had endowed them with (faculties of) hearing,seeing,heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their (faculties of) hearing,sight,and heart and intellect,when they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah; and they were (completely) encircled by that which they used to mock at!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|27|We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown the Signs in various ways,that they may turn (to Us).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|28|Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods,besides Allah,as a means of access (to Allah)? Nay,they left them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|29|Behold,We turned towards thee a company of Jinns (quietly) listening to the Qur´an: when they stood in the presence thereof,they said," ""Listen in silence!"" When the (reading) was finished",they returned to their people,to warn (them of their sins).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|30|They said," ""O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses",confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|31|""O our people",hearken to the one who invites (you) to Allah,and believe in him: He will forgive you your faults,and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"46|32|""If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to Allah",he cannot frustrate (Allah´s Plan) on earth," and no protectors can he have besides Allah: such men (wander) in manifest error.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|33|See they not that Allah,Who created the heavens and the earth,and never wearied with their creation,is able to give life to the dead? Yea,verily He has power over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|34|And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire,(they will be asked,") ""Is this not the Truth?"" they will say"," ""Yea"," by our Lord!"" (One will say:) ""Then taste ye the Penalty"," for that ye were wont to deny (Truth)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
46|35|Therefore patiently persevere,as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them,(it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|1|Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah,- their deeds will Allah render astray (from their mark).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|2|But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness,and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|3|This because those who reject Allah follow vanities,while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does Allah set forth for men their lessons by similitudes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|4|Therefore,when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight),smite at their necks; At length,when ye have thoroughly subdued them,bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah´s Will,He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you,some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,
47|5|Soon will He guide them and improve their condition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|6|And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|7|O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah,He will aid you,and plant your feet firmly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|8|But those who reject (Allah),#NAME?,and (Allah) will render their deeds astray (from their mark).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|9|That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their deeds fruitless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|10|Do they not travel through the earth,and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil)? Allah brought utter destruction on them,and similar (fates await) those who reject Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|11|That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe,but those who reject Allah have no protector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|12|Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds,to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|13|And how many cities,with more power than thy city which has driven thee out,have We destroyed (for their sins)? and there was none to aid them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|14|Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord,no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing,and such as follow their own lusts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|15|(Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine,a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire,and be given,to drink,boiling water,so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|16|And among them are men who listen to thee,but in the end,when they go out from thee,they say to those who have received Knowledge," ""What is it he said just then?"" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed",and who follow their own lusts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|17|But to those who receive Guidance,He increases the (light of) Guidance,and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|18|Do they then only wait for the Hour,#NAME?,and when it (actually) is on them,how can they benefit then by their admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|19|Know,therefore,that there is no god but Allah,and ask forgiveness for thy fault,and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|20|Those who believe say," ""Why is not a sura sent down (for us)?"" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed",and fighting is mentioned therein,thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|21|Were it to obey and say what is just,and when a matter is resolved on,it were best for them if they were true to Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|22|Then,is it to be expected of you,if ye were put in authority,that ye will do mischief in the land,and break your ties of kith and kin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|23|Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|24|Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur´an,or are their hearts locked up by them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|25|Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|26|This,because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed," ""We will obey you in part of (this) matter""; but Allah knows their (inner) secrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|27|But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death,and smite their faces and their backs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|28|This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah,and they hated Allah´s good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|29|Or do those in whose hearts is a disease,think that Allah will not bring to light all their rancour?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|30|Had We so wiled,We could have shown them up to thee,and thou shouldst have known them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And Allah knows all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|31|And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|32|Those who reject Allah,hinder (men) from the Path of Allah,and resist the Messenger,after Guidance has been clearly shown to them,will not injure Allah in the least,but He will make their deeds of no effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|33|O ye who believe! Obey Allah,and obey the messenger,and make not vain your deeds!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|34|Those who reject Allah,and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah,then die rejecting Allah,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|35|Be not weary and faint-hearted,crying for peace,when ye should be uppermost: for Allah is with you,and will never put you in loss for your (good) deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|36|The life of this world is but play and amusement: and if ye believe and guard against Evil,He will grant you your recompense,and will not ask you (to give up) your possessions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|37|If He were to ask you for all of them,and press you,ye would covetously withhold,and He would bring out all your ill-feeling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47|38|Behold,ye are those invited to spend (of your substance) in the Way of Allah: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls. But Allah is free of all wants,and it is ye that are needy. If ye turn back (from the Path),He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|1|Verily We have granted thee a manifest Victory:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|2|That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the Straight Way;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|3|And that Allah may help thee with powerful help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|4|It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers,that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|5|That He may admit the men and women who believe,to Gardens beneath which rivers flow,to dwell therein for aye,and remove their ills from them;- and that is,in the sight of Allah,the highest achievement (for man),-,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|6|And that He may punish the Hypocrites,men and women,and the Polytheists men and women,who imagine an evil opinion of Allah. On them is a round of Evil: the Wrath of Allah is on them: He has cursed them and got Hell ready for them: and evil is it for a destination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|7|For to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Exalted in Power,Full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|8|We have truly sent thee as a witness,as a bringer of Glad Tidings,and as a Warner:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|9|In order that ye (O men) may believe in Allah and His Messenger,that ye may assist and honour Him,and celebrate His praise morning and evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|10|Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah: the Hand of Allah is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath,does so to the harm of his own soul,and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"48|11|The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: ""We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds"," and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us."" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: ""Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allah",if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"48|12|""Nay",ye thought that the Messenger and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts,and ye conceived an evil thought," for ye are a people lost (in wickedness).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|13|And if any believe not in Allah and His Messenger,We have prepared,for those who reject Allah,a Blazing Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|14|To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He wills,and He punishes whom He wills: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|15|Those who lagged behind (will say)," when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): ""Permit us to follow you."" They wish to change Allah´s decree: Say: ""Not thus will ye follow us: Allah has already declared (this) beforehand"": then they will say"," ""But ye are jealous of us."" Nay",but little do they understand (such things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"48|16|Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: ""Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight",or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience,Allah will grant you a goodly reward,but if ye turn back as ye did before," He will punish you with a grievous Penalty.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|17|No blame is there on the blind,nor is there blame on the lame,nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger,- (Allah) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back,(Allah) will punish him with a grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|18|Allah´s Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts,and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|19|And many gains will they acquire (besides): and Allah is Exalted in Power,Full of Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|20|Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire,and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers,and that He may guide you to a Straight Path;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|21|And other gains (there are),which are not within your power,but which Allah has compassed: and Allah has power over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|22|If the Unbelievers should fight you,they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|23|(Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|24|And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka,after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|25|They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals,detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge,(Allah would have allowed you to force your way,but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart,We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|26|While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,#NAME?,and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|27|Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque,if Allah wills,with minds secure,heads shaved,hair cut short,and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not,and He granted,besides this,a speedy victory.,,,,,,,,,,
48|28|It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth,to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48|29|Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers,(but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer),seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks,(being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade,then makes it strong; it then becomes thick,and it stands on its own stem,(filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result,it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness,and a great Reward.,,,,,,,,,,
49|1|O Ye who believe! Put not yourselves forward before Allah and His Messenger; but fear Allah: for Allah is He Who hears and knows all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|2|O ye who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet,nor speak aloud to him in talk,as ye may speak aloud to one another,lest your deeds become vain and ye perceive not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|3|Those that lower their voices in the presence of Allah´s Messenger,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|4|Those who shout out to thee from without the inner apartments - most of them lack understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|5|If only they had patience until thou couldst come out to them,it would be best for them: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|6|O ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news,ascertain the truth,lest ye harm people unwittingly,and afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|7|And know that among you is Allah´s Messenger: were he,in many matters,to follow your (wishes),ye would certainly fall into misfortune: But Allah has endeared the Faith to you,and has made it beautiful in your hearts,and He has made hateful to you Unbelief,wickedness,and rebellion: such indeed are those who walk in righteousness;-,,,,,,,,,,,
49|8|A Grace and Favour from Allah; and Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|9|If two parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel,make ye peace between them: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other,then fight ye (all) against the one that transgresses until it complies with the command of Allah; but if it complies,then make peace between them with justice,and be fair: for Allah loves those who are fair (and just).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|10|The Believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; and fear Allah,that ye may receive Mercy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|11|O ye who believe! Let not some men among you laugh at others: It may be that the (latter) are better than the (former): Nor let some women laugh at others: It may be that the (latter are better than the (former): Nor defame nor be sarcastic to each other,nor call each other by (offensive) nicknames: Ill-seeming is a name connoting wickedness,(to be used of one) after he has believed: And those who do not desist are (indeed) doing wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|12|O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: And spy not on each other behind their backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Nay,ye would abhor it...But fear Allah: For Allah is Oft-Returning,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|13|O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female,and made you into nations and tribes,that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|14|The desert Arabs say," ""We believe."" Say"," ""Ye have no faith; but ye (only)say",´We have submitted our wills to Allah,´ For not yet has Faith entered your hearts. But if ye obey Allah and His Messenger,He will not belittle aught of your deeds: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving," Most Merciful.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
49|15|Only those are Believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger,and have never since doubted,but have striven with their belongings and their persons in the Cause of Allah: Such are the sincere ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"49|16|Say: ""What! Will ye instruct Allah about your religion? But Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on earth: He has full knowledge of all things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49|17|They impress on thee as a favour that they have embraced Islam. Say," ""Count not your Islam as a favour upon me: Nay",Allah has conferred a favour upon you that He has guided you to the faith,if ye be true and sincere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"49|18|""Verily Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth: and Allah Sees well all that ye do.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|1|Qaf: By the Glorious Qur´an (Thou art Allah´s Messenger).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|2|But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves. So the Unbelievers say: ""This is a wonderful thing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|3|""What! When we die and become dust"," (shall we live again?) That is a (sort of) return far (from our understanding).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|4|We already know how much of them the earth takes away: With Us is a record guarding (the full account).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|5|But they deny the Truth when it comes to them: so they are in a confused state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|6|Do they not look at the sky above them?- How We have made it and adorned it,and there are no flaws in it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|7|And the earth- We have spread it out,and set thereon mountains standing firm,and produced therein every kind of beautiful growth (in pairs)-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|8|To be observed and commemorated by every devotee turning (to Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|9|And We send down from the sky rain charted with blessing,and We produce therewith gardens and Grain for harvests;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|10|And tall (and stately) palm-trees,with shoots of fruit-stalks,piled one over another;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|11|As sustenance for (Allah´s) Servants;- and We give (new) life therewith to land that is dead: Thus will be the Resurrection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|12|Before them was denied (the Hereafter) by the People of Noah,the Companions of the Rass,the Thamud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|13|The ´Ad,Pharaoh,the brethren of Lut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|14|The Companions of the Wood,and the People of Tubba´; each one (of them) rejected the messengers,and My warning was duly fulfilled (in them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|15|Were We then weary with the first Creation,that they should be in confused doubt about a new Creation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|16|It was We Who created man,and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|17|Behold,two (guardian angels) appointed to learn (his doings) learn (and noted them),one sitting on the right and one on the left.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|18|Not a word does he utter but there is a sentinel by him,ready (to note it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|19|And the stupor of death will bring Truth (before his eyes): ""This was the thing which thou wast trying to escape!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|20|And the Trumpet shall be blown: that will be the Day whereof Warning (had been given).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|21|And there will come forth every soul: with each will be an (angel) to drive,and an (angel) to bear witness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|22|(It will be said:) ""Thou wast heedless of this; now have We removed thy veil"," and sharp is thy sight this Day!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|23|And his Companion will say: ""Here is (his Record) ready with me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|24|(The sentence will be:) ""Throw",throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter (of Allah)!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|25|""Who forbade what was good",transgressed all bounds,cast doubts and suspicions;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|26|""Who set up another god beside Allah: Throw him into a severe penalty.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|27|His Companion will say: ""Our Lord! I did not make him transgress"," but he was (himself) far astray.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|28|He will say: ""Dispute not with each other in My Presence: I had already in advance sent you Warning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|29|""The Word changes not before Me"," and I do not the least injustice to My Servants.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|30|One Day We will ask Hell," ""Art thou filled to the full?"" It will say"," ""Are there any more (to come)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|31|And the Garden will be brought nigh to the Righteous,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50|32|(A voice will say:) ""This is what was promised for you",#NAME?,who kept (His Law),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50|35|There will be for them therein all that they wish,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|36|But how many generations before them did We destroy (for their sins),- stronger in power than they? Then did they wander through the land: was there any place of escape (for them)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|37|Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|38|We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days,nor did any sense of weariness touch Us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|39|Bear,then,with patience,all that they say,and celebrate the praises of thy Lord,before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|40|And during part of the night,(also,) celebrate His praises,and (so likewise) after the postures of adoration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|41|And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place quiet near,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|42|The Day when they will hear a (mighty) Blast in (very) truth: that will be the Day of Resurrection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|43|Verily it is We Who give Life and Death; and to Us is the Final Goal-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|44|The Day when the Earth will be rent asunder,from (men) hurrying out: that will be a gathering together,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50|45|We know best what they say; and thou art not one to overawe them by force. So admonish with the Qur´an such as fear My Warning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|1|By the (Winds) that scatter broadcast;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|2|And those that lift and bear away heavy weights;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|3|And those that flow with ease and gentleness;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|4|And those that distribute and apportion by Command;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|5|Verily that which ye are promised is true;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|6|And verily Judgment and Justice must indeed come to pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|7|By the Sky with (its) numerous Paths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|8|Truly ye are in a doctrine discordant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|9|Through which are deluded (away from the Truth) such as would be deluded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|10|Woe to the falsehood-mongers,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|11|Those who (flounder) heedless in a flood of confusion:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|12|They ask," ""When will be the Day of Judgment and Justice?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|13|(It will be) a Day when they will be tried (and tested) over the Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"51|14|""Taste ye your trial! This is what ye used to ask to be hastened!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|15|As to the Righteous,they will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|16|Taking joy in the things which their Lord gives them,because,before then,they lived a good life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|17|They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|18|And in the hour of early dawn,they (were found) praying for Forgiveness;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|19|And in their wealth and possessions (was remembered) the right of the (needy,) him who asked,and him who (for some reason) was prevented (from asking).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|20|On the earth are signs for those of assured Faith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|21|As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|22|And in heaven is your Sustenance,as (also) that which ye are promised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|23|Then,by the Lord of heaven and earth,this is the very Truth,as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|24|Has the story reached thee,of the honoured guests of Abraham?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|25|Behold,they entered his presence," and said: ""Peace!"" He said"," ""Peace!"" (and thought"," ""These seem) unusual people.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|26|Then he turned quickly to his household,brought out a fatted calf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|27|And placed it before them.. he said," ""Will ye not eat?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|28|(When they did not eat),He conceived a fear of them. They said," ""Fear not"," and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.
51|29|But his wife came forward (laughing) aloud: she smote her forehead and said: A barren old woman!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|30|They said," ""Even so has thy Lord spoken: and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"51|31|(Abraham) said: ""And what",O ye Messengers," is your errand (now)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|32|They said," ""We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin;-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"51|33|""To bring on",on them,(a shower of) stones of clay (brimstone),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"51|34|""Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|35|Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|36|But We found not there any just (Muslim) persons except in one house:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|37|And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|38|And in Moses (was another Sign): Behold,We sent him to Pharaoh,with authority manifest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|39|But (Pharaoh) turned back with his Chiefs,and said," ""A sorcerer"," or one possessed!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|40|So We took him and his forces,and threw them into the sea; and his was the blame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|41|And in the ´Ad (people) (was another Sign): Behold,We sent against them the devastating Wind:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|42|It left nothing whatever that it came up against,but reduced it to ruin and rottenness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|43|And in the Thamud (was another Sign): Behold,they were told," ""Enjoy (your brief day) for a little while!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|44|But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise (of an earthquake) seized them,even while they were looking on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|45|Then they could not even stand (on their feet),nor could they help themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|46|So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|47|With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of pace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|48|And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|49|And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|50|Hasten ye then (at once) to Allah: I am from Him a Warner to you,clear and open!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|51|And make not another an object of worship with Allah: I am from Him a Warner to you,clear and open!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|52|Similarly,no messenger came to the Peoples before them,but they said (of him) in like manner," ""A sorcerer"," or one possessed""!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|53|Is this the legacy they have transmitted,one to another? Nay,they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|54|So turn away from them: not thine is the blame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|55|But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|56|I have only created Jinns and men,that they may serve Me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|57|No Sustenance do I require of them,nor do I require that they should feed Me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|58|For Allah is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,#NAME?,- Steadfast (for ever).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|59|For the Wrong-doers,their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows (of earlier generations): then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51|60|Woe,then,to the Unbelievers,on account of that Day of theirs which they have been promised!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|1|By the Mount (of Revelation);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|2|By a Decree inscribed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|3|In a Scroll unfolded;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|4|By the much-frequented Fane;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|5|By the Canopy Raised High;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|6|And by the Ocean filled with Swell;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|7|Verily,the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|8|There is none can avert it;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|9|On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|10|And the mountains will fly hither and thither.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|11|Then woe that Day to those that treat (Truth) as Falsehood;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|12|That play (and paddle) in shallow trifles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|13|That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell,irresistibly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|14|""This:",it will be said," ""Is the Fire",- which ye were wont to deny!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|15|""Is this then a fake",or is it ye that do not see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|16|""Burn ye therein: the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience"," or not: Ye but receive the recompense of your (own) deeds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|17|As to the Righteous,they will be in Gardens,and in Happiness,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|18|Enjoying the (Bliss) which their Lord hath bestowed on them,and their Lord shall deliver them from the Penalty of the Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|19|(To them will be said:) ""Eat and drink ye",with profit and health," because of your (good) deeds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|20|They will recline (with ease) on Thrones (of dignity) arranged in ranks; and We shall join them to Companions,with beautiful big and lustrous eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|21|And those who believe and whose families follow them in Faith,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|22|And We shall bestow on them,of fruit and meat,anything they shall desire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|23|They shall there exchange,one with another,a (loving) cup free of frivolity,free of all taint of ill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|24|Round about them will serve,(devoted) to them,young male servants (handsome) as Pearls well-guarded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|25|They will advance to each other,engaging in mutual enquiry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|26|They will say: ""Aforetime",we were not without fear for the sake of our people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|27|""But Allah has been good to us",and has delivered us from the Penalty of the Scorching Wind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|28|""Truly",we did call unto Him from of old: truly it is He,the Beneficent," the Merciful!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|29|Therefore proclaim thou the praises (of thy Lord): for by the Grace of thy Lord,thou art no (vulgar) soothsayer,nor art thou one possessed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|30|Or do they say:- ""A Poet! we await for him some calamity (hatched) by Time!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52|31|Say thou: ""Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|32|Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this,or are they but a people transgressing beyond bounds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|33|Or do they say," ""He fabricated the (Message)""? Nay",they have no faith!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|34|Let them then produce a recital like unto it,- If (it be) they speak the truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|35|Were they created of nothing,or were they themselves the creators?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|36|Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay,they have no firm belief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|37|Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them,or are they the managers (of affairs)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|38|Or have they a ladder,by which they can (climb up to heaven and) listen (to its secrets)? Then let (such a) listener of theirs produce a manifest proof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|39|Or has He only daughters and ye have sons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|40|Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward,so that they are burdened with a load of debt?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|41|Or that the Unseen in it their hands,and they write it down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|42|Or do they intend a plot (against thee)? But those who defy Allah are themselves involved in a Plot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|43|Or have they a god other than Allah? Exalted is Allah far above the things they associate with Him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|44|Were they to see a piece of the sky falling (on them)," they would (only) say: ""Clouds gathered in heaps!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|45|So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs,wherein they shall (perforce) swoon (with terror),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|46|The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall be given them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|47|And verily,for those who do wrong,there is another punishment besides this: But most of them understand not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|48|Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Our eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52|49|And for part of the night also praise thou Him,- and at the retreat of the stars!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|1|By the Star when it goes down,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|2|Your Companion is neither astray nor being misled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|3|Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|4|It is no less than inspiration sent down to him:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|5|He was taught by one Mighty in Power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|6|Endued with Wisdom: for he appeared (in stately form);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|7|While he was in the highest part of the horizon:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|8|Then he approached and came closer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|9|And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|10|So did (Allah) convey the inspiration to His Servant- (conveyed) what He (meant) to convey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|11|The (Prophet´s) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|12|Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|13|For indeed he saw him at a second descent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|14|Near the Lote-tree beyond which none may pass:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|15|Near it is the Garden of Abode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|16|Behold,the Lote-tree was shrouded (in mystery unspeakable!),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|17|(His) sight never swerved,nor did it go wrong!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|18|For truly did he see,of the Signs of his Lord,the Greatest!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|19|Have ye seen Lat. and ´Uzza,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|20|And another,the third (goddess),Manat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|21|What! for you the male sex,and for Him,the female?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|22|Behold,such would be indeed a division most unfair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|23|These are nothing but names which ye have devised,#NAME?,- for which Allah has sent down no authority (whatever). They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire!- Even though there has already come to them Guidance from their Lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|24|Nay,shall man have (just) anything he hankers after?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|25|But it is to Allah that the End and the Beginning (of all things) belong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|26|How many-so-ever be the angels in the heavens,their intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He pleases and that he is acceptable to Him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|27|Those who believe not in the Hereafter,name the angels with female names.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|28|But they have no knowledge therein. They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against Truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|29|Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but the life of this world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|30|That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Verily thy Lord knoweth best those who stray from His Path,and He knoweth best those who receive guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|31|Yea,to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil,according to their deeds,and He rewards those who do good,with what is best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|32|Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds,only (falling into) small faults,#NAME?,And when ye are hidden in your mothers´ wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|33|Seest thou one who turns back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|34|Gives a little,then hardens (his heart)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|35|What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|36|Nay,is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|37|And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|38|Namely,that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|39|That man can have nothing but what he strives for;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|40|That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|41|Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|42|That to thy Lord is the final Goal;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|43|That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|44|That it is He Who granteth Death and Life;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|45|That He did create in pairs,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|46|From a seed when lodged (in its place);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|47|That He hath promised a Second Creation (Raising of the Dead);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|48|That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|49|That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|50|And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) ancient ´Ad (people),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|51|And the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|52|And before them,the people of Noah,for that they were (all) most unjust and most insolent transgressors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|53|And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|54|So that (ruins unknown) have covered them up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|55|Then which of the gifts of thy Lord,(O man,) wilt thou dispute about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|56|This is a Warner,of the (series of) Warners of old!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|57|The (Judgment) ever approaching draws nigh:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|58|No (soul) but Allah can lay it bare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|59|Do ye then wonder at this recital?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|60|And will ye laugh and not weep,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|61|Wasting your time in vanities?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53|62|But fall ye down in prostration to Allah,and adore (Him)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|1|The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh,and the moon is cleft asunder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|2|But if they see a Sign,they turn away,and say," ""This is (but) transient magic.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|3|They reject (the warning) and follow their (own) lusts but every matter has its appointed time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|4|There have already come to them Recitals wherein there is (enough) to check (them),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|5|Mature wisdom;- but (the preaching of) Warners profits them not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|6|Therefore,(O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day that the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|7|They will come forth,#NAME?,(torpid) like locusts scattered abroad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|8|Hastening,with eyes transfixed," towards the Caller!- ""Hard is this Day!""",the Unbelievers will say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|9|Before them the People of Noah rejected (their messenger): they rejected Our servant,and said," ""Here is one possessed!""",and he was driven out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54|10|Then he called on his Lord: ""I am one overcome: do Thou then help (me)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|11|So We opened the gates of heaven,with water pouring forth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|12|And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs,so the waters met (and rose) to the extent decreed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|13|But We bore him on an (Ark) made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fibre:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|14|She floats under our eyes (and care): a recompense to one who had been rejected (with scorn)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|15|And We have left this as a Sign (for all time): then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|16|But how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|17|And We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|18|The ´Ad (people) (too) rejected (Truth): then how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|19|For We sent against them a furious wind,on a Day of violent Disaster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|20|Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up (from the ground).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|21|Yea,how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|22|But We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|23|The Thamud (also) rejected (their) Warners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54|24|For they said: ""What! a man! a Solitary one from among ourselves! shall we follow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind",and mad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54|25|""Is it that the Message is sent to him",of all people amongst us? Nay,he is a liar," an insolent one!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|26|Ah! they will know on the morrow,which is the liar,the insolent one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|27|For We will send the she-camel by way of trial for them. So watch them,(O Salih),and possess thyself in patience!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|28|And tell them that the water is to be divided between them: Each one´s right to drink being brought forward (by suitable turns).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|29|But they called to their companion,and he took a sword in hand,and hamstrung (her).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|30|Ah! how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|31|For We sent against them a single Mighty Blast,and they became like the dry stubble used by one who pens cattle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|32|And We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|33|The people of Lut rejected (his) warning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|34|We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones,(which destroyed them),except Lut´s household: them We delivered by early Dawn,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|35|As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|36|And (Lut) did warn them of Our Punishment,but they disputed about the Warning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|37|And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him," but We blinded their eyes. (They heard:) ""Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|38|Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54|39|""So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|40|And We have indeed made the Qur´an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|41|To the People of Pharaoh,too,aforetime,came Warners (from Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|42|The (people) rejected all Our Signs; but We seized them with such Penalty (as comes) from One Exalted in Power,able to carry out His Will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|43|Are your Unbelievers,(O Quraish),better than they? Or have ye an immunity in the Sacred Books?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54|44|Or do they say: ""We acting together can defend ourselves""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|45|Soon will their multitude be put to flight,and they will show their backs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|46|Nay,the Hour (of Judgment) is the time promised them (for their full recompense): And that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|47|Truly those in sin are the ones straying in mind,and mad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|48|The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces," (they will hear:) ""Taste ye the touch of Hell!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|49|Verily,all things have We created in proportion and measure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|50|And Our Command is but a single (Act),#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|51|And (oft) in the past,have We destroyed gangs like unto you: then is there any that will receive admonition?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|52|All that they do is noted in (their) Books (of Deeds):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|53|Every matter,small and great,is on record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54|54|As to the Righteous,they will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55|13|Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55|14|He created man from sounding clay like unto pottery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55|43|This is the Hell which the Sinners deny:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55|44|In its midst and in the midst of boiling hot water will they wander round!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55|45|Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55|46|But for such as fear the time when they will stand before (the Judgment Seat of) their Lord,there will be two Gardens-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55|78|Blessed be the name of thy Lord,full of Majesty,Bounty and Honour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56|45|For that they were wont to be indulged,before that,in wealth (and luxury),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

57|24|Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men. And if any turn back (from Allah´s Way),verily Allah is Free of all Needs,Worthy of all Praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57|25|We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong),that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron,in which is (material for) mighty war,as well as many benefits for mankind,that Allah may test who it is that will help,Unseen,Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength,Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will).,,,,,,,,,,,
57|26|And We sent Noah and Abraham,and established in their line Prophethood and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance. But many of them became rebellious transgressors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57|27|Then,in their wake,We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary,and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves,We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed,on those among them who believed,their (due) reward,but many of them are rebellious transgressors.,,,,,,,,,,,
57|28|O ye that believe! Fear Allah,and believe in His Messenger,and He will bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path),and He will forgive you (your past): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57|29|That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of Allah,that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand,to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|1|Allah has indeed heard (and accepted) the statement of the woman who pleads with thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint (in prayer) to Allah: and Allah (always) hears the arguments between both sides among you: for Allah hears and sees (all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|2|If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers),they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And in fact they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly Allah is one that blots out (sins),and forgives (again and again).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|3|But those who divorce their wives by Zihar,then wish to go back on the words they uttered,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|4|And if any has not (the wherewithal),he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so,he should feed sixty indigent ones,this,that ye may show your faith in Allah and His Messenger. Those are limits (set by) Allah. For those who reject (Him),there is a grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|5|Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be humbled to dust,as were those before them: for We have already sent down Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers (will have) a humiliating Penalty,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|6|On the Day that Allah will raise them all up (again) and show them the Truth (and meaning) of their conduct. Allah has reckoned its (value),though they may have forgotten it,for Allah is Witness to all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|7|Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret consultation between three,but He makes the fourth among them,- Nor between five but He makes the sixth,#NAME?,but He is in their midst,wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct,on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|8|Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden (to do)? And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility,and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to thee,they salute thee,not as Allah salutes thee,(but in crooked ways): And they say to themselves," ""Why does not Allah punish us for our words?"" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn",and evil is that destination!,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|9|O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel,do it not for iniquity and hostility,and disobedience to the Prophet; but do it for righteousness and self-restraint; and fear Allah,to Whom ye shall be brought back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|10|Secret counsels are only (inspired) by the Evil One,in order that he may cause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least,except as Allah permits; and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|11|O ye who believe! When ye are told to make room in the assemblies,(spread out and) make room: (ample) room will Allah provide for you. And when ye are told to rise up,rise up Allah will rise up,to (suitable) ranks (and degrees),those of you who believe and who have been granted (mystic) Knowledge. And Allah is well-acquainted with all ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|12|O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private,spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be best for you,and most conducive to purity (of conduct). But if ye find not (the wherewithal),Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|13|Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with him)? If,then,ye do not so,and Allah forgives you,then (at least) establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|14|Turnest thou not thy attention to those who turn (in friendship) to such as have the Wrath of Allah upon them? They are neither of you nor of them,and they swear to falsehood knowingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|15|Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|16|They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|17|Of no profit whatever to them,against Allah,will be their riches nor their sons: they will be Companions of the Fire,to dwell therein (for aye)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|18|One day will Allah raise them all up (for Judgment): then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No,indeed! they are but liars!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|19|The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose the remembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly,it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|20|Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"58|21|Allah has decreed: ""It is I and My messengers who must prevail"": For Allah is One full of strength",able to enforce His Will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58|22|Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day,loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger,even though they were their fathers or their sons,or their brothers,or their kindred. For such He has written Faith in their hearts,and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow,to dwell therein (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them,and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity.,,,,,,,,,,,
59|1|Whatever is in the heavens and on earth,let it declare the Praises and Glory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might,the Wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|2|It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it),and cast terror into their hearts,so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers,take warning,then,O ye with eyes (to see)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|3|And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them,He would certainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall (certainly) have the Punishment of the Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|4|That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resists Allah,verily Allah is severe in Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|5|Whether ye cut down (O ye Muslim!) The tender palm-trees,or ye left them standing on their roots,it was by leave of Allah,and in order that He might cover with shame the rebellious transgresses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|6|What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: but Allah gives power to His messengers over any He pleases: and Allah has power over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|7|What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships,#NAME?,#NAME?,the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger assigns to you,and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah is strict in Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|8|(Some part is due) to the indigent Muhajirs,those who were expelled from their homes and their property,while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure,and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|9|But those who before them,had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith,#NAME?,and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the (latter),but give them preference over themselves,even though poverty was their (own lot).

"59|11|Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book? - ""If ye are expelled",we too will go out with you," and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you"". But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|12|If they are expelled,never will they go out with them; and if they are attacked (in fight),they will never help them; and if they do help them,they will turn their backs; so they will receive no help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|13|Of a truth ye are stronger (than they) because of the terror in their hearts,(sent) by Allah. This is because they are men devoid of understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|14|They will not fight you (even) together,except in fortified townships,or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting (spirit) amongst themselves: thou wouldst think they were united,but their hearts are divided: that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|15|Like those who lately preceded them,they have tasted the evil result of their conduct; and (in the Hereafter there is) for them a grievous Penalty;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59|16|(Their allies deceived them),like the Evil One,when he says to man," ""Deny Allah"": but when (man) denies Allah",(the Evil One) says," ""I am free of thee: I do fear Allah"," the Lord of the Worlds!""",,,,,,,,,,,,

If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure,(take them not as friends),holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal. And any of you that does this has strayed from the Straight Path.,,,,,,,,,,,,
60|2|If they were to get the better of you,they would behave to you as enemies,and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you for evil: and they desire that ye should reject the Truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

60|8|Allah forbids you not,with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes,from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60|9|Allah only forbids you,with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith,and drive you out of your homes,and support (others) in driving you out,from turning to them (for friendship and protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances),that do wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60|10|O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees,examine (and test) them: Allah knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers,then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers,nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower),and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers,and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of Allah: He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60|11|And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers,and ye have an accession (by the coming over of a woman from the other side),then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent (on their dower). And fear Allah,in Whom ye believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60|12|O Prophet!

60|13|O ye who believe! Turn not (for friendship) to people on whom is the Wrath of Allah,of the Hereafter they are already in despair,just as the Unbelievers are in despair about those (buried) in graves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|1|Whatever is in the heavens and on earth,let it declare the Praises and Glory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might,the Wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|2|O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|3|Grievously odious is it in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|4|Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array,as if they were a solid cemented structure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|5|And remember," Moses said to his people: ""O my people! why do ye vex and insult me"," though ye know that I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you?"" Then when they went wrong",Allah let their hearts go wrong. For Allah guides not those who are rebellious transgressors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|6|And remember,Jesus,the son of Mary," said: ""O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you",confirming the Law (which came) before me,and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me," whose name shall be Ahmad."" But when he came to them with Clear Signs",they said," ""this is evident sorcery!""",,,,,,,,,,

61|13|And another (favour will He bestow,) which ye do love,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61|14|O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples," ""Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?""

62|4|Such is the Bounty of Allah,which He bestows on whom He will: and Allah is the Lord of the highest bounty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62|5|The similitude of those who were charged with the (obligations of the) Mosaic Law,but who subsequently failed in those (obligations),is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes (but understands them not).

"62|6|Say: ""O ye that stand on Judaism! If ye think that ye are friends to Allah",to the exclusion of (other) men,then express your desire for Death," if ye are truthful!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62|7|But never will they express their desire (for Death),because of the (deeds) their hands have sent on before them! and Allah knows well those that do wrong!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

62|10|And when the Prayer is finished,then may ye disperse through the land,and seek of the Bounty of Allah: and celebrate the Praises of Allah often (and without stint): that ye may prosper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62|11|But when they see some bargain or some amusement,they disperse headlong to it," and leave thee standing. Say: ""The (blessing) from the Presence of Allah is better than any amusement or bargain! and Allah is the Best to provide (for all needs).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|1|When the Hypocrites come to thee,they say," ""We bear witness that thou art indeed the Messenger of Allah."" Yea",Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His Messenger,and Allah beareth witness that the Hypocrites are indeed liars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|2|They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: truly evil are their deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|3|That is because they believed,then they rejected Faith: So a seal was set on their hearts: therefore they understand not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|4|When thou lookest at them,their exteriors please thee; and when they speak,thou listenest to their words. They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up,(unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them. The curse of Allah be on them! How are they deluded (away from the Truth)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|5|And when it is said to them," ""Come"," the Messenger of Allah will pray for your forgiveness""",they turn aside their heads,and thou wouldst see them turning away their faces in arrogance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|6|It is equal to them whether thou pray for their forgiveness or not. Allah will not forgive them. Truly Allah guides not rebellious transgressors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|7|They are the ones who say," ""Spend nothing on those who are with Allah´s Messenger"," to the end that they may disperse (and quit Medina)."" But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the Hypocrites understand not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|8|They say," ""If we return to Medina"," surely the more honourable (element) will expel therefrom the meaner."" But honour belongs to Allah and His Messenger",and to the Believers; but the Hypocrites know not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|9|O ye who believe! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. If any act thus,the loss is their own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|10|and spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you,before Death should come to any of you and he should say," ""O my Lord! why didst Thou not give me respite for a little while? I should then have given (largely) in charity"," and I should have been one of the doers of good"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63|11|But to no soul will Allah grant respite when the time appointed (for it) has come; and Allah is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64|4|He knows what is in the heavens and on earth; and He knows what ye conceal and what ye reveal: yea,Allah knows well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64|5|Has not the story reached you,of those who rejected Faith aforetime? So they tasted the evil result of their conduct; and they had a grievous Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64|6|That was because there came to them messengers with Clear Signs," but they said: ""Shall (mere) human beings direct us?"" So they rejected (the Message) and turned away. But Allah can do without (them): and Allah is free of all needs",worthy of all praise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64|7|The Unbelievers think that they will not be raised up (for Judgment). Say: ""Yea",By my Lord," Ye shall surely be raised up: then shall ye be told (the truth) of all that ye did. And that is easy for Allah.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64|11|No kind of calamity can occur,except by the leave of Allah: and if any one believes in Allah,(Allah) guides his heart (aright): for Allah knows all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64|12|So obey Allah,and obey His Messenger: but if ye turn back,the duty of Our Messenger is but to proclaim (the Message) clearly and openly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64|13|Allah! There is no god but He: and on Allah,therefore,let the Believers put their trust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64|14|O ye who believe! Truly,among your wives and your children are (some that are) enemies to yourselves: so beware of them! But if ye forgive and overlook,and cover up (their faults),verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

65|1|O Prophet! When ye do divorce women,divorce them at their prescribed periods,and count (accurately),their prescribed periods: And fear Allah your Lord: and turn them not out of their houses,nor shall they (themselves) leave,except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness,those are limits set by Allah: and any who transgresses the limits of Allah,does verily wrong his (own) soul: thou knowest not if perchance Allah will bring about thereafter some new situation.,,,,,,,,,,,
65|2|Thus when they fulfil their term appointed,either take them back on equitable terms or part with them on equitable terms; and take for witness two persons from among you,endued with justice,and establish the evidence (as) before Allah. Such is the admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And for those who fear Allah,He (ever) prepares a way out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|3|And He provides for him from (sources) he never could imagine. And if any one puts his trust in Allah,sufficient is (Allah) for him. For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily,for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|4|Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses,for them the prescribed period,if ye have any doubts,is three months,and for those who have no courses (it is the same): for those who carry (life within their wombs),their period is until they deliver their burdens: and for those who fear Allah,He will make their path easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|5|That is the Command of Allah,which He has sent down to you: and if any one fears Allah,He will remove his ills,from him,and will enlarge his reward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|6|Let the women live (in ´iddat) in the same style as ye live,according to your means: Annoy them not,so as to restrict them. And if they carry (life in their wombs),then spend (your substance) on them until they deliver their burden: and if they suckle your (offspring),give them their recompense: and take mutual counsel together,according to what is just and reasonable. And if ye find yourselves in difficulties,let another woman suckle (the child) on the (father´s) behalf.,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|7|Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources are restricted,let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. After a difficulty,Allah will soon grant relief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|8|How many populations that insolently opposed the Command of their Lord and of His messengers,did We not then call to account,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|9|Then did they taste the evil result of their conduct,and the End of their conduct was Perdition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|10|Allah has prepared for them a severe Punishment (in the Hereafter). Therefore fear Allah,O ye men of understanding - who have believed!- for Allah hath indeed sent down to you a Message,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|11|An Messenger,who rehearses to you the Signs of Allah containing clear explanations,that he may lead forth those who believe and do righteous deeds from the depths of Darkness into Light. And those who believe in Allah and work righteousness,He will admit to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow,to dwell therein for ever: Allah has indeed granted for them a most excellent Provision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65|12|Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of the earth a similar number. Through the midst of them (all) descends His Command: that ye may know that Allah has power over all things,and that Allah comprehends,all things in (His) Knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|1|O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|2|Allah has already ordained for you,(O men),the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector,and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|3|When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his consorts,and she then divulged it (to another),and Allah made it known to him,he confirmed part thereof and repudiated a part. Then when he told her thereof,she said," ""Who told thee this? ""He said"," ""He told me Who knows and is well-acquainted (with all things).""",,,,,,,,,,,,
66|4|If ye two turn in repentance to Him,your hearts are indeed so inclined; But if ye back up each other against him,truly Allah is his Protector,and Gabriel,and (every) righteous one among those who believe,#NAME?,the angels - will back (him) up.,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|5|It may be,if he divorced you (all),that Allah will give him in exchange consorts better than you,#NAME?,who believe,who are devout,who turn to Allah in repentance,who worship (in humility),who travel (for Faith) and fast,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,
66|6|O ye who believe! save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is Men and Stones,over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe,who flinch not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah,but do (precisely) what they are commanded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|7|(They will say)," ""O ye Unbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! Ye are being but requited for all that ye did!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|8|O ye who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance: In the hope that your Lord will remove from you your ills and admit you to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow,#NAME?,while they say," ""Our Lord! Perfect our Light for us"," and grant us Forgiveness: for Thou hast power over all things.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|9|O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites,and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|10|Allah sets forth,for an example to the Unbelievers,the wife of Noah and the wife of Lut: they were (respectively) under two of our righteous servants,but they were false to their (husbands),and they profited nothing before Allah on their account," but were told: ""Enter ye the Fire along with (others) that enter!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|11|And Allah sets forth," as an example to those who believe the wife of Pharaoh: Behold she said: ""O my Lord! Build for me",in nearness to Thee,a mansion in the Garden,and save me from Pharaoh and his doings," and save me from those that do wrong"";",,,,,,,,,,,,,
66|12|And Mary the daughter of ´Imran,who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (her body) of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of His Revelations,and was one of the devout (servants).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|1|Blessed be He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things hath Power;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|2|He Who created Death and Life,that He may try which of you is best in deed: and He is the Exalted in Might,Oft-Forgiving;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|3|He Who created the seven heavens one above another: No want of proportion wilt thou see in the Creation of (Allah) Most Gracious. So turn thy vision again: seest thou any flaw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|4|Again turn thy vision a second time: (thy) vision will come back to thee dull and discomfited,in a state worn out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|5|And we have,(from of old),adorned the lowest heaven with Lamps,and We have made such (Lamps) (as) missiles to drive away the Evil Ones,and have prepared for them the Penalty of the Blazing Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|6|For those who reject their Lord (and Cherisher) is the Penalty of Hell: and evil is (such),Destination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|7|When they are cast therein,they will hear the (terrible) drawing in of its breath even as it blazes forth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|8|Almost bursting with fury: Every time a Group is cast therein,its Keepers will ask," ""Did no Warner come to you?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"67|9|They will say: ""Yes indeed; a Warner did come to us",but we rejected him and said," ´Allah never sent down any (Message): ye are nothing but an egregious delusion!´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"67|10|They will further say: ""Had we but listened or used our intelligence"," we should not (now) be among the Companions of the Blazing Fire!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|11|They will then confess their sins: but far will be (Forgiveness) from the Companions of the Blazing Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|12|As for those who fear their Lord unseen,for them is Forgiveness and a great Reward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|13|And whether ye hide your word or publish it,He certainly has (full) knowledge,of the secrets of (all) hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|14|Should He not know,- He that created? and He is the One that understands the finest mysteries (and) is well-acquainted (with them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|15|It is He Who has made the earth manageable for you,so traverse ye through its tracts and enjoy of the Sustenance which He furnishes: but unto Him is the Resurrection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|16|Do ye feel secure that He Who is in heaven will not cause you to be swallowed up by the earth when it shakes (as in an earthquake)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|17|Or do ye feel secure that He Who is in Heaven will not send against you a violent tornado (with showers of stones),so that ye shall know how (terrible) was My warning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|18|But indeed men before them rejected (My warning): then how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|19|Do they not observe the birds above them,spreading their wings and folding them in? None can uphold them except (Allah) Most Gracious: Truly (Allah) Most Gracious: Truly it is He that watches over all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|20|Nay,who is there that can help you,(even as) an army,besides (Allah) Most Merciful? In nothing but delusion are the Unbelievers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|21|Or who is there that can provide you with Sustenance if He were to withhold His provision? Nay,they obstinately persist in insolent impiety and flight (from the Truth).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67|22|Is then one who walks headlong,with his face grovelling,better guided,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"67|23|Say: ""It is He Who has created you (and made you grow)",and made for you the faculties of hearing,seeing,feeling and understanding: little thanks it is ye give.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

68|17|Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden,when they resolved to gather the fruits of the (garden) in the morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|18|But made no reservation," (""If it be Allah´s Will"").",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|19|Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from thy Lord,(which swept away) all around,while they were asleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|20|So the (garden) became,by the morning,like a dark and desolate spot,(whose fruit had been gathered).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|21|As the morning broke,they called out,one to another,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|22|""Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning"," if ye would gather the fruits.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|23|So they departed,conversing in secret low tones,(saying)-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|24|""Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the (garden) this day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|25|And they opened the morning,strong in an (unjust) resolve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|26|But when they saw the (garden)," they said: ""We have surely lost our way:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|27|""Indeed we are shut out (of the fruits of our labour)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|28|Said one of them," more just (than the rest): ""Did I not say to you"," ´Why not glorify (Allah)?´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|29|They said: ""Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|30|Then they turned,one against another,in reproach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|31|They said: ""Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|32|""It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: for we do turn to Him (in repentance)!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|33|Such is the Punishment (in this life); but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter,- if only they knew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|34|Verily,for the Righteous,are Gardens of Delight,in the Presence of their Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|35|Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|36|What is the matter with you? How judge ye?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|37|Or have ye a book through which ye learn-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|38|That ye shall have,through it whatever ye choose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|39|Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath,reaching to the Day of Judgment,(providing) that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|40|Ask thou of them,which of them will stand surety for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"68|41|Or have they some ""Partners"" (in Allahhead)? Then let them produce their ""partners""",if they are truthful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|42|The Day that the shin shall be laid bare,and they shall be summoned to bow in adoration,but they shall not be able,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68|43|Their eyes will be cast down,- ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration,while they were whole,(and had refused).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|1|The Sure Reality!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|4|The Thamud and the ´Ad People (branded) as false the Stunning Calamity!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|7|He made it rage against them seven nights and eight days in succession: so that thou couldst see the (whole) people lying prostrate in its (path),as they had been roots of hollow palm-trees tumbled down!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|8|Then seest thou any of them left surviving?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|9|And Pharaoh,and those before him,and the Cities Overthrown,committed habitual Sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|10|And disobeyed (each) the messenger of their Lord; so He punished them with an abundant Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|11|We,when the water (of Noah´s Flood) overflowed beyond its limits,carried you (mankind),in the floating (Ark),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|12|That We might make it a Message unto you,and that ears (that should hear the tale and) retain its memory should bear its (lessons) in remembrance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|13|Then,when one blast is sounded on the Trumpet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|14|And the earth is moved,and its mountains,and they are crushed to powder at one stroke,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|15|On that Day shall the (Great) Event come to pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|17|And the angels will be on its sides,and eight will,that Day,bear the Throne of thy Lord above them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|18|That Day shall ye be brought to Judgment: not an act of yours that ye hide will be hidden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"69|19|Then he that will be given his Record in his right hand will say: ""Ah here! Read ye my Record!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"69|20|""I did really understand that my Account would (One Day) reach me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|21|And he will be in a life of Bliss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|23|The Fruits whereof (will hang in bunches) low and near.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|38|So I do call to witness what ye see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|39|And what ye see not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|40|That this is verily the word of an honoured messenger;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|41|It is not the word of a poet: little it is ye believe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|42|Nor is it the word of a soothsayer: little admonition it is ye receive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|43|(This is) a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|45|We should certainly seize him by his right hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|46|And We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|47|Nor could any of you withhold him (from Our wrath).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69|49|And We certainly know that there are amongst you those that reject (it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69|50|But truly (Revelation) is a cause of sorrow for the Unbelievers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70|19|Truly man was created very impatient;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|20|Fretful when evil touches him;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|21|And niggardly when good reaches him;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|22|Not so those devoted to Prayer;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|23|Those who remain steadfast to their prayer;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|24|And those in whose wealth is a recognised right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|25|For the (needy) who asks and him who is prevented (for some reason from asking);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|26|And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|27|And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|28|For their Lord´s displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70|36|Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before thee-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|37|From the right and from the left,in crowds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|38|Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|39|By no means! For We have created them out of the (base matter) they know!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|40|Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|41|Substitute for them better (men) than they; And We are not to be defeated (in Our Plan).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70|42|So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about,until they encounter that Day of theirs which they have been promised!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

72|2|´It gives guidance to the Right,and we have believed therein: we shall not join (in worship) any (gods) with our Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|3|´And Exalted is the Majesty of our Lord: He has taken neither a wife nor a son.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|4|´There were some foolish ones among us,who used to utter extravagant lies against Allah;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|5|´But we do think that no man or spirit should say aught that untrue against Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|6|´True,there were persons among mankind who took shelter with persons among the Jinns,but they increased them in folly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|7|´And they (came to) think as ye thought,that Allah would not raise up any one (to Judgment).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|8|´And we pried into the secrets of heaven; but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|9|´We used,indeed,to sit there in (hidden) stations,to (steal) a hearing; but any who listen now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|10|´And we understand not whether ill is intended to those on earth,or whether their Lord (really) intends to guide them to right conduct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|11|´There are among us some that are righteous,and some the contrary: we follow divergent paths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|12|´But we think that we can by no means frustrate Allah throughout the earth,nor can we frustrate Him by flight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|13|´And as for us,since we have listened to the Guidance,we have accepted it: and any who believes in his Lord has no fear,either of a short (account) or of any injustice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|14|´Amongst us are some that submit their wills (to Allah),and some that swerve from justice. Now those who submit their wills - they have sought out (the path) of right conduct:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|15|´But those who swerve,- they are (but) fuel for Hell-fire´-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|16|(And Allah´s Message is): ""If they (the Pagans) had (only) remained on the (right) Way",We should certainly have bestowed on them Rain in abundance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|17|""That We might try them by that (means). But if any turns away from the remembrance of his Lord",He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|18|""And the places of worship are for Allah (alone): So invoke not any one along with Allah;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|19|""Yet when the Devotee of Allah stands forth to invoke Him"," they just make round him a dense crowd.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|20|Say: ""I do no more than invoke my Lord"," and I join not with Him any (false god).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|21|Say: ""It is not in my power to cause you harm"," or to bring you to right conduct.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|22|Say: ""No one can deliver me from Allah (If I were to disobey Him)",nor should I find refuge except in Him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|23|""Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages: for any that disobey Allah and His Messenger","- for them is Hell: they shall dwell therein for ever.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72|24|At length,when they see (with their own eyes) that which they are promised,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|25|Say: ""I know not whether the (Punishment) which ye are promised is near",or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|26|""He (alone) knows the Unseen",nor does He make any one acquainted with His Mysteries,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|27|""Except a messenger whom He has chosen: and then He makes a band of watchers march before him and behind him",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"72|28|""That He may know that they have (truly) brought and delivered the Messages of their Lord: and He surrounds (all the mysteries) that are with them"," and takes account of every single thing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|1|O thou folded in garments!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|2|Stand (to prayer) by night,but not all night,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|3|Half of it,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|4|Or a little more; and recite the Qur´an in slow,measured rhythmic tones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|5|Soon shall We send down to thee a weighty Message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|6|Truly the rising by night is most potent for governing (the soul),and most suitable for (framing) the Word (of Prayer and Praise).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|7|True,there is for thee by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|8|But keep in remembrance the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him whole-heartedly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|9|(He is) Lord of the East and the West: there is no god but He: take Him therefore for (thy) Disposer of Affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|10|And have patience with what they say,and leave them with noble (dignity).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|11|And leave Me (alone to deal with) those in possession of the good things of life,who (yet) deny the Truth; and bear with them for a little while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|12|With Us are Fetters (to bind them),and a Fire (to burn them),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|13|And a Food that chokes,and a Penalty Grievous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|14|One Day the earth and the mountains will be in violent commotion. And the mountains will be as a heap of sand poured out and flowing down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|15|We have sent to you,(O men!) a messenger,to be a witness concerning you,even as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|16|But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him with a heavy Punishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|17|Then how shall ye,if ye deny (Allah),guard yourselves against a Day that will make children hoary-headed?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|18|Whereon the sky will be cleft asunder? His Promise needs must be accomplished.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|19|Verily this is an Admonition: therefore,whoso will,let him take a (straight) path to his Lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73|20|Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth (to prayer) nigh two-thirds of the night,or half the night,or a third of the night,and so doth a party of those with thee. But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth that ye are unable to keep count thereof. So He hath turned to you (in mercy): read ye,therefore,of the Qur´an as much as may be easy for you. He knoweth that there may be (some) among you in ill-health; others travelling through the land,seeking of Allah´s bounty; yet others fighting in Allah´s Cause,read ye,therefore,as much of the Qur´an as may be easy (for you); and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan. And whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah´s Presence,#NAME?,better and greater,in Reward and seek ye the Grace of Allah: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful.,,,,,
74|1|O thou wrapped up (in the mantle)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|2|Arise and deliver thy warning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|3|And thy Lord do thou magnify!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|4|And thy garments keep free from stain!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|5|And all abomination shun!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|6|Nor expect,in giving,any increase (for thyself)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|7|But,for thy Lord´s (Cause),be patient and constant!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|8|Finally,when the Trumpet is sounded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|9|That will be- that Day - a Day of Distress,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|10|Far from easy for those without Faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|11|Leave Me alone,(to deal) with the (creature) whom I created (bare and) alone!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|12|To whom I granted resources in abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|13|And sons to be by his side!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|14|To whom I made (life) smooth and comfortable!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|15|Yet is he greedy-that I should add (yet more);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|16|By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|17|Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|18|For he thought and he plotted;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|19|And woe to him! How he plotted!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|20|Yea,Woe to him; How he plotted!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|21|Then he looked round;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|22|Then he frowned and he scowled;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|23|Then he turned back and was haughty;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|24|Then said he: ""This is nothing but magic",derived from of old;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|25|""This is nothing but the word of a mortal!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|26|Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|27|And what will explain to thee what Hell-Fire is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|28|Naught doth it permit to endure,and naught doth it leave alone!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|29|Darkening and changing the colour of man!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|30|Over it are Nineteen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|31|And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers,#NAME?,and the Believers may increase in Faith,#NAME?,and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say," ""What symbol doth Allah intend by this?"" Thus doth Allah leave to stray whom He pleaseth",and guide whom He pleaseth: and none can know the forces of thy Lord,except He and this is no other than a warning to mankind.,,,,,,,,,,,
74|32|Nay,verily: By the Moon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|33|And by the Night as it retreateth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|34|And by the Dawn as it shineth forth,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|35|This is but one of the mighty (portents),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|36|A warning to mankind,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|37|To any of you that chooses to press forward,or to follow behind;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|38|Every soul will be (held) in pledge for its deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|39|Except the Companions of the Right Hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|40|(They will be) in Gardens (of Delight): they will question each other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|41|And (ask) of the Sinners:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|42|""What led you into Hell Fire?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|43|They will say: ""We were not of those who prayed;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|44|""Nor were we of those who fed the indigent;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|45|""But we used to talk vanities with vain talkers;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|46|""And we used to deny the Day of Judgment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"74|47|""Until there came to us (the Hour) that is certain.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|48|Then will no intercession of (any) intercessors profit them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|49|Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from admonition?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|50|As if they were affrighted asses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|51|Fleeing from a lion!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|52|Forsooth,each one of them wants to be given scrolls (of revelation) spread out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|53|By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|54|Nay,this surely is an admonition:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|55|Let any who will,keep it in remembrance!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74|56|But none will keep it in remembrance except as Allah wills: He is the Lord of Righteousness,and the Lord of Forgiveness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|1|I do call to witness the Resurrection Day;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|2|And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: (Eschew Evil).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|3|Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|4|Nay,We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|5|But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time in front of him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"75|6|He questions: ""When is the Day of Resurrection?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|7|At length,when the sight is dazed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|8|And the moon is buried in darkness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|9|And the sun and moon are joined together,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"75|10|That Day will Man say: ""Where is the refuge?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|11|By no means! No place of safety!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|12|Before thy Lord (alone),that Day will be the place of rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|13|That Day will Man be told (all) that he put forward,and all that he put back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|14|Nay,man will be evidence against himself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|15|Even though he were to put up his excuses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|16|Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur´an) to make haste therewith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|17|It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|18|But when We have promulgated it,follow thou its recital (as promulgated):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|19|Nay more,it is for Us to explain it (and make it clear):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|20|Nay,(ye men!) but ye love the fleeting life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|21|And leave alone the Hereafter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|22|Some faces,that Day,will beam (in brightness and beauty);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|23|Looking towards their Lord;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|24|And some faces,that Day,will be sad and dismal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|25|In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted on them;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|26|Yea,when (the soul) reaches to the collar-bone (in its exit),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|27|And there will be a cry," ""Who is a magician (to restore him)?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|28|And he will conclude that it was (the Time) of Parting;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|29|And one leg will be joined with another:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|30|That Day the Drive will be (all) to thy Lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|31|So he gave nothing in charity,nor did he pray!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|32|But on the contrary,he rejected Truth and turned away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|33|Then did he stalk to his family in full conceit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|34|Woe to thee,(O men!),yea,woe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|35|Again,Woe to thee,(O men!),yea,woe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|36|Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled,(without purpose)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|37|Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (in lowly form)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|38|Then did he become a leech-like clot; then did (Allah) make and fashion (him) in due proportion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|39|And of him He made two sexes,male and female.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75|40|Has not He,(the same),the power to give life to the dead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|1|Has there not been over Man a long period of Time,when he was nothing - (not even) mentioned?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|2|Verily We created Man from a drop of mingled sperm,in order to try him: So We gave him (the gifts),of Hearing and Sight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|3|We showed him the Way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his will).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|4|For the Rejecters we have prepared chains,yokes,and a blazing Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|5|As to the Righteous,they shall drink of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Kafur,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|6|A Fountain where the Devotees of Allah do drink,making it flow in unstinted abundance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|7|They perform (their) vows,and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|8|And they feed,for the love of Allah,the indigent,the orphan,and the captive,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|9|(Saying),"We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks.
76|10|We only fear a Day of distressful Wrath from the side of our Lord.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|11|But Allah will deliver them from the evil of that Day,and will shed over them a Light of Beauty and (blissful) Joy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|12|And because they were patient and constant,He will reward them with a Garden and (garments of) silk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|13|Reclining in the (Garden) on raised thrones,they will see there neither the sun´s (excessive heat) nor (the moon´s) excessive cold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|14|And the shades of the (Garden) will come low over them,and the bunches (of fruit),there,will hang low in humility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|15|And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|16|Crystal-clear,made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|17|And they will be given to drink there of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Zanjabil,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|18|A fountain there,called Salsabil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|19|And round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness): If thou seest them,thou wouldst think them scattered Pearls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|20|And when thou lookest,it is there thou wilt see a Bliss and a Realm Magnificent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|21|Upon them will be green Garments of fine silk and heavy brocade,and they will be adorned with Bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give to them to drink of a Wine Pure and Holy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"76|22|""Verily this is a Reward for you"," and your Endeavour is accepted and recognised.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|23|It is We Who have sent down the Qur´an to thee by stages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|24|Therefore be patient with constancy to the Command of thy Lord,and hearken not to the sinner or the ingrate among them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|25|And celebrate the name of thy Lord morning and evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|26|And part of the night,prostrate thyself to Him; and glorify Him a long night through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|27|As to these,they love the fleeting life,and put away behind them a Day (that will be) hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|28|It is We Who created them,and We have made their joints strong; but,when We will,We can substitute the like of them by a complete change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|29|This is an admonition: Whosoever will,let him take a (straight) Path to his Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|30|But ye will not,except as Allah wills; for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76|31|He will admit to His Mercy whom He will; But the wrong-doers,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|1|By the (Winds) sent forth one after another (to man´s profit);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|2|Which then blow violently in tempestuous Gusts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|3|And scatter (things) far and wide;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|4|Then separate them,one from another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|5|Then spread abroad a Message,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|6|Whether of Justification or of Warning;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|7|Assuredly,what ye are promised must come to pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|8|Then when the stars become dim;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|9|When the heaven is cleft asunder;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|10|When the mountains are scattered (to the winds) as dust;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|11|And when the messengers are (all) appointed a time (to collect);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|12|For what Day are these (portents) deferred?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|13|For the Day of Sorting out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|14|And what will explain to thee what is the Day of Sorting out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|15|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|16|Did We not destroy the men of old (for their evil)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|17|So shall We make later (generations) follow them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|18|Thus do We deal with men of sin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|19|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|20|Have We not created you from a fluid (held) despicable?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|21|The which We placed in a place of rest,firmly fixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|22|For a period (of gestation),determined (according to need)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|23|For We do determine (according to need); for We are the best to determine (things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|24|Ah woe,that Day! to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|25|Have We not made the earth (as a place) to draw together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|26|The living and the dead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|27|And made therein mountains standing firm,lofty (in stature); and provided for you water sweet (and wholesome)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|28|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|29|(It will be said:) ""Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|30|""Depart ye to a Shadow (of smoke ascending) in three columns",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|31|""(Which yields) no shade of coolness",and is of no use against the fierce Blaze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|32|""Indeed it throws about sparks (huge) as Forts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|33|""As if there were (a string of) yellow camels (marching swiftly).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|34|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|35|That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|36|Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|37|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|38|That will be a Day of Sorting out! We shall gather you together and those before (you)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|39|Now,if ye have a trick (or plot),use it against Me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|40|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|41|As to the Righteous,they shall be amidst (cool) shades and springs (of water).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|42|And (they shall have) fruits,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"77|43|""Eat ye and drink ye to your heart´s content: for that ye worked (Righteousness).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|44|Thus do We certainly reward the Doers of Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|45|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|46|(O ye unjust!) Eat ye and enjoy yourselves (but) a little while,for that ye are Sinners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|47|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|48|And when it is said to them," ""Prostrate yourselves!"" they do not so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|49|Ah woe,that Day,to the Rejecters of Truth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77|50|Then what Message,after that,will they believe in?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|1|Concerning what are they disputing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|2|Concerning the Great News,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|3|About which they cannot agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|4|Verily,they shall soon (come to) know!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|5|Verily,verily they shall soon (come to) know!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|6|Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|7|And the mountains as pegs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|8|And (have We not) created you in pairs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|9|And made your sleep for rest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|10|And made the night as a covering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|11|And made the day as a means of subsistence?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|12|And (have We not) built over you the seven firmaments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|13|And placed (therein) a Light of Splendour?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|14|And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|15|That We may produce therewith corn and vegetables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|16|And gardens of luxurious growth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|17|Verily the Day of Sorting out is a thing appointed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|18|The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded,and ye shall come forth in crowds;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|19|And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|20|And the mountains shall vanish,as if they were a mirage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|21|Truly Hell is as a place of ambush,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|22|For the transgressors a place of destination:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|23|They will dwell therein for ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|24|Nothing cool shall they taste therein,nor any drink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|25|Save a boiling fluid and a fluid,dark,murky,intensely cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|26|A fitting recompense (for them).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|27|For that they used not to fear any account (for their deeds),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|28|But they (impudently) treated Our Signs as false.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|29|And all things have We preserved on record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"78|30|""So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds); for no increase shall We grant you"," except in Punishment.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|31|Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart´s) desires;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|32|Gardens enclosed,and grapevines;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|33|And voluptuous women of equal age;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|34|And a cup full (to the brim).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|35|No vanity shall they hear therein,nor Untruth:-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|36|Recompense from thy Lord,a gift,(amply) sufficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|37|(From) the Lord of the heavens and the earth,and all between,(Allah) Most Gracious: None shall have power to argue with Him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|38|The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand forth in ranks,none shall speak except any who is permitted by (Allah) Most Gracious,and He will say what is right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|39|That Day will be the sure Reality: Therefore,whoso will,let him take a (straight) return to his Lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78|40|Verily,We have warned you of a Penalty near,the Day when man will see (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth,and the Unbeliever will say," ""Woe unto me! Would that I were (metre) dust!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|1|By the (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with violence;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|2|By those who gently draw out (the souls of the blessed);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|3|And by those who glide along (on errands of mercy),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|4|Then press forward as in a race,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|5|Then arrange to do (the Commands of their Lord),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|6|One Day everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|7|Followed by oft-repeated (commotions):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|8|Hearts that Day will be in agitation;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|9|Cast down will be (their owners´) eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|10|They say (now): ""What! shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|11|""What! - when we shall have become rotten bones?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|12|They say: ""It would",in that case," be a return with loss!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|13|But verily,it will be but a single (Compelling) Cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|14|When,behold,they will be in the (full) awakening (to Judgment).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|15|Has the story of Moses reached thee?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|16|Behold,thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|17|""Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|18|""And say to him",´Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin)?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"79|19|""´And that I guide thee to thy Lord"," so thou shouldst fear Him?´""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|20|Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|21|But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|22|Further,he turned his back,striving hard (against Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|23|Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|24|Saying," ""I am your Lord"," Most High"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|25|But Allah did punish him,(and made an) example of him,- in the Hereafter,as in this life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|26|Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth (Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|27|What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven (above)? (Allah) hath constructed it:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|28|On high hath He raised its canopy,and He hath given it order and perfection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|29|Its night doth He endow with darkness,and its splendour doth He bring out (with light).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|30|And the earth,moreover,hath He extended (to a wide expanse);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|31|He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|32|And the mountains hath He firmly fixed;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|33|For use and convenience to you and your cattle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|34|Therefore,when there comes the great,overwhelming (Event),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|35|The Day when man shall remember (all) that he strove for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|36|And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for (all) to see,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|37|Then,for such as had transgressed all bounds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|38|And had preferred the life of this world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|39|The Abode will be Hell-Fire;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|40|And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord´s (tribunal) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|41|Their abode will be the Garden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|42|They ask thee about the Hour,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|43|Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|44|With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|45|Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79|46|The Day they see it,(It will be) as if they had tarried but a single evening,or (at most till) the following morn!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|1|(The Prophet) frowned and turned away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|2|Because there came to him the blind man (interrupting).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|3|But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow (in spiritual understanding)?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|4|Or that he might receive admonition,and the teaching might profit him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|5|As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|6|To him dost thou attend;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|7|Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not (in spiritual understanding).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|8|But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|9|And with fear (in his heart),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|10|Of him wast thou unmindful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|11|By no means (should it be so)! For it is indeed a Message of instruction:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|12|Therefore let whoso will,keep it in remembrance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|13|(It is) in Books held (greatly) in honour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|14|Exalted (in dignity),kept pure and holy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|15|(Written) by the hands of scribes-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|16|Honourable and Pious and Just.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|17|Woe to man! What hath made him reject Allah;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|18|From what stuff hath He created him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|19|From a sperm-drop: He hath created him,and then mouldeth him in due proportions;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|20|Then doth He make His path smooth for him;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|21|Then He causeth him to die,and putteth him in his grave;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|22|Then,when it is His Will,He will raise him up (again).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|23|By no means hath he fulfilled what Allah hath commanded him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|24|Then let man look at his food,(and how We provide it):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|25|For that We pour forth water in abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|26|And We split the earth in fragments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|27|And produce therein corn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|28|And Grapes and nutritious plants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|29|And Olives and Dates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|30|And enclosed Gardens,dense with lofty trees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|31|And fruits and fodder,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|32|For use and convenience to you and your cattle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|33|At length,when there comes the Deafening Noise,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|34|That Day shall a man flee from his own brother,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|35|And from his mother and his father,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|36|And from his wife and his children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|37|Each one of them,that Day,will have enough concern (of his own) to make him indifferent to the others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|38|Some faces that Day will be beaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|39|Laughing,rejoicing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|40|And other faces that Day will be dust-stained,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|41|Blackness will cover them:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80|42|Such will be the Rejecters of Allah,the doers of iniquity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|1|When the sun (with its spacious light) is folded up;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|2|When the stars fall,losing their lustre;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|3|When the mountains vanish (like a mirage);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|4|When the she-camels,ten months with young,are left untended;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|5|When the wild beasts are herded together (in the human habitations);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|6|When the oceans boil over with a swell;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|7|When the souls are sorted out,(being joined,like with like);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|8|When the female (infant),buried alive,is questioned -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|9|For what crime she was killed;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|10|When the scrolls are laid open;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|11|When the world on High is unveiled;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|12|When the Blazing Fire is kindled to fierce heat;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|13|And when the Garden is brought near;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|14|(Then) shall each soul know what it has put forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|15|So verily I call to witness the planets - that recede,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|16|Go straight,or hide;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|17|And the Night as it dissipates;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|18|And the Dawn as it breathes away the darkness;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|19|Verily this is the word of a most honourable Messenger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|20|Endued with Power,with rank before the Lord of the Throne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|21|With authority there,(and) faithful to his trust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|22|And (O people!) your companion is not one possessed;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|23|And without doubt he saw him in the clear horizon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|24|Neither doth he withhold grudgingly a knowledge of the Unseen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|25|Nor is it the word of an evil spirit accursed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|26|When whither go ye?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|27|Verily this is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|28|(With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81|29|But ye shall not will except as Allah wills,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|1|When the Sky is cleft asunder;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|2|When the Stars are scattered;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|3|When the Oceans are suffered to burst forth;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|4|And when the Graves are turned upside down;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|5|(Then) shall each soul know what it hath sent forward and (what it hath) kept back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|6|O man! What has seduced thee from thy Lord Most Beneficent?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|7|Him Who created thee. Fashioned thee in due proportion,and gave thee a just bias;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|8|In whatever Form He wills,does He put thee together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|9|Nay! But ye do reject Right and Judgment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|10|But verily over you (are appointed angels) to protect you,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|11|Kind and honourable,- Writing down (your deeds):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|12|They know (and understand) all that ye do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|13|As for the Righteous,they will be in bliss;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|14|And the Wicked - they will be in the Fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|15|Which they will enter on the Day of Judgment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|16|And they will not be able to keep away therefrom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|17|And what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|18|Again,what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82|19|(It will be) the Day when no soul shall have power (to do) aught for another: For the command,that Day,will be (wholly) with Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|1|Woe to those that deal in fraud,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|2|Those who,when they have to receive by measure from men,exact full measure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|3|But when they have to give by measure or weight to men,give less than due.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|4|Do they not think that they will be called to account?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|5|On a Mighty Day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|6|A Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|7|Nay! Surely the record of the wicked is (preserved) in Sijjin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|8|And what will explain to thee what Sijjin is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|9|(There is) a Register (fully) inscribed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|10|Woe,that Day,to those that deny-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|11|Those that deny the Day of Judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|12|And none can deny it but the Transgressor beyond bounds the Sinner!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|13|When Our Signs are rehearsed to him,he says," ""Tales of the ancients!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|14|By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the (ill) which they do!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|15|Verily,from (the Light of) their Lord,that Day,will they be veiled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|16|Further,they will enter the Fire of Hell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|17|Further," it will be said to them: ""This is the (reality) which ye rejected as false!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|18|Day,verily the record of the Righteous is (preserved) in ´Illiyin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|19|And what will explain to thee what ´Illiyun is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|20|(There is) a Register (fully) inscribed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|21|To which bear witness those Nearest (to Allah).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|22|Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|23|On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|24|Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|25|Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|26|The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire,who have aspirations:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|27|With it will be (given) a mixture of Tasnim:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|28|A spring,from (the waters) whereof drink those Nearest to Allah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|29|Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|30|And whenever they passed by them,used to wink at each other (in mockery);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|31|And when they returned to their own people,they would return jesting;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|32|And whenever they saw them,they would say," ""Behold! These are the people truly astray!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|33|But they had not been sent as keepers over them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|34|But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|35|On Thrones (of Dignity) they will command (a sight) (of all things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83|36|Will not the Unbelievers have been paid back for what they did?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|1|When the sky is rent asunder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|2|And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord,and it must needs (do so);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|3|And when the earth is flattened out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|4|And casts forth what is within it and becomes (clean) empty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|5|And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord,- and it must needs (do so);- (then will come Home the full reality).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|6|O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|7|Then he who is given his Record in his right hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|8|Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|9|And he will turn to his people,rejoicing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|10|But he who is given his Record behind his back,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|11|Soon will he cry for perdition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|12|And he will enter a Blazing Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|13|Truly,did he go about among his people,rejoicing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|14|Truly,did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|15|Nay,nay! for his Lord was (ever) watchful of him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|16|So I do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|17|The Night and its Homing;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|18|And the Moon in her fullness:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|19|Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|20|What then is the matter with them,that they believe not?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|21|And when the Qur´an is read to them,they fall not prostrate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|22|But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject (it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|23|But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete (in their breasts),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|24|So announce to them a Penalty Grievous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84|25|Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward that will never fail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|1|By the sky,(displaying) the Zodiacal Signs;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|2|By the promised Day (of Judgment);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|3|By one that witnesses,and the subject of the witness;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|4|Woe to the makers of the pit (of fire),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|5|Fire supplied (abundantly) with fuel:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|6|Behold! they sat over against the (fire),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|7|And they witnessed (all) that they were doing against the Believers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|8|And they ill-treated them for no other reason than that they believed in Allah,Exalted in Power,Worthy of all Praise!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|9|Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness to all things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|10|Those who persecute (or draw into temptation) the Believers,men and women,and do not turn in repentance,will have the Penalty of Hell: They will have the Penalty of the Burning Fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|11|For those who believe and do righteous deeds,will be Gardens; beneath which rivers flow: That is the great Salvation,(the fulfilment of all desires),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|12|Truly strong is the Grip (and Power) of thy Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|13|It is He Who creates from the very beginning,and He can restore (life).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|14|And He is the Oft-Forgiving,Full of Loving-Kindness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|15|Lord of the Throne of Glory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|16|Doer (without let) of all that He intends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|17|Has the story reached thee,of the forces-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|18|Of Pharaoh and the Thamud?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|19|And yet the Unbelievers (persist) in rejecting (the Truth)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|20|But Allah doth encompass them from behind!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|21|Day,this is a Glorious Qur´an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85|22|(Inscribed) in a Tablet Preserved!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|1|By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (therein);-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|2|And what will explain to thee what the Night-Visitant is?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|3|(It is) the Star of piercing brightness;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|4|There is no soul but has a protector over it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|5|Now let man but think from what he is created!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|6|He is created from a drop emitted-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|7|Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|8|Surely (Allah) is able to bring him back (to life)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|9|The Day that (all) things secret will be tested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|10|(Man) will have no power,and no helper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|11|By the Firmament which returns (in its round),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|12|And by the Earth which opens out (for the gushing of springs or the sprouting of vegetation),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|13|Behold this is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|14|It is not a thing for amusement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|15|As for them,they are but plotting a scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|16|And I am planning a scheme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86|17|Therefore grant a delay to the Unbelievers: Give respite to them gently (for awhile).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|1|Glorify the name of thy Guardian-Lord Most High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|2|Who hath created,and further,given order and proportion;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|3|Who hath ordained laws. And granted guidance;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|4|And Who bringeth out the (green and luscious) pasture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|5|And then doth make it (but) swarthy stubble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|6|By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message),so thou shalt not forget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|7|Except as Allah wills: For He knoweth what is manifest and what is hidden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|8|And We will make it easy for thee (to follow) the simple (Path).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|9|Therefore give admonition in case the admonition profits (the hearer).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|10|The admonition will be received by those who fear (Allah):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|11|But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|12|Who will enter the Great Fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|13|In which they will then neither die nor live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|14|But those will prosper who purify themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|15|And glorify the name of their Guardian-Lord,and (lift their hearts) in prayer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|16|Day (behold),ye prefer the life of this world;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|17|But the Hereafter is better and more enduring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|18|And this is in the Books of the earliest (Revelation),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87|19|The Books of Abraham and Moses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|1|Has the story reached thee of the overwhelming (Event)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|2|Some faces,that Day,will be humiliated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|3|Labouring (hard),weary,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|4|The while they enter the Blazing Fire,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|5|The while they are given,to drink,of a boiling hot spring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|6|No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari´,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|7|Which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|8|(Other) faces that Day will be joyful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|9|Pleased with their striving,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|10|In a Garden on high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|11|Where they shall hear no (word) of vanity:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|12|Therein will be a bubbling spring:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|13|Therein will be Thrones (of dignity),raised on high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|14|Goblets placed (ready),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|15|And cushions set in rows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|16|And rich carpets (all) spread out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|17|Do they not look at the Camels,how they are made?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|18|And at the Sky,how it is raised high?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|19|And at the Mountains,how they are fixed firm?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|20|And at the Earth,how it is spread out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|21|Therefore do thou give admonition,for thou art one to admonish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|22|Thou art not one to manage (men´s) affairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|23|But if any turn away and reject Allah,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|24|Allah will punish him with a mighty Punishment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|25|For to Us will be their return;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88|26|Then it will be for Us to call them to account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|1|By the break of Day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|2|By the Nights twice five;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|3|By the even and odd (contrasted);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|4|And by the Night when it passeth away;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|5|Is there (not) in these an adjuration (or evidence) for those who understand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|6|Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the ´Ad (people),-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|7|Of the (city of) Iram,with lofty pillars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|8|The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|9|And with the Thamud (people),who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|10|And with Pharaoh,lord of stakes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|11|(All) these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|12|And heaped therein mischief (on mischief).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|13|Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|14|For thy Lord is (as a Guardian) on a watch-tower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|15|Now,as for man,when his Lord trieth him,giving him honour and gifts,then saith he,(puffed up)," ""My Lord hath honoured me.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
89|16|But when He trieth him,restricting his subsistence for him,then saith he (in despair)," ""My Lord hath humiliated me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|17|Nay,nay! but ye honour not the orphans!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|18|Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|19|And ye devour inheritance - all with greed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|20|And ye love wealth with inordinate love!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|21|Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|22|And thy Lord cometh,and His angels,rank upon rank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|23|And Hell,that Day,is brought (face to face),#NAME?,but how will that remembrance profit him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"89|24|He will say: ""Ah! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my (Future) Life!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|25|For,that Day,His Chastisement will be such as none (else) can inflict,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89|26|And His bonds will be such as none (other) can bind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"89|27|(To the righteous soul will be said:) ""O (thou) soul",in (complete) rest and satisfaction!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"89|28|""Come back thou to thy Lord",#NAME?,and well-pleasing unto Him!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90|1|I do call to witness this City;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|2|And thou art a freeman of this City;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|3|And (the mystic ties of) parent and child;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|4|Verily We have created man into toil and struggle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|5|Thinketh he,that none hath power over him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|6|He may say (boastfully); Wealth have I squandered in abundance!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|7|Thinketh he that none beholdeth him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|8|Have We not made for him a pair of eyes?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|9|And a tongue,and a pair of lips?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|10|And shown him the two highways?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|11|But he hath made no haste on the path that is steep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|12|And what will explain to thee the path that is steep?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|13|(It is:) freeing the bondman;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|14|Or the giving of food in a day of privation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|15|To the orphan with claims of relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|16|Or to the indigent (down) in the dust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|17|Then will he be of those who believe,and enjoin patience,(constancy,and self-restraint),and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|18|Such are the Companions of the Right Hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|19|But those who reject Our Signs,they are the (unhappy) Companions of the Left Hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90|20|On them will be Fire vaulted over (all round).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|1|By the Sun and his (glorious) splendour;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|2|By the Moon as she follows him;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|3|By the Day as it shows up (the Sun´s) glory;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|4|By the Night as it conceals it;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|5|By the Firmament and its (wonderful) structure;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|6|By the Earth and its (wide) expanse:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|7|By the Soul,and the proportion and order given to it;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|8|And its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|9|Truly he succeeds that purifies it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|10|And he fails that corrupts it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|11|The Thamud (people) rejected (their prophet) through their inordinate wrong-doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|12|Behold,the most wicked man among them was deputed (for impiety).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"91|13|But the Messenger of Allah said to them: ""It is a She-camel of Allah! And (bar her not from) having her drink!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|14|Then they rejected him (as a false prophet),and they hamstrung her. So their Lord,on account of their crime,obliterated their traces and made them equal (in destruction,high and low)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91|15|And for Him is no fear of its consequences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|1|By the Night as it conceals (the light);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|2|By the Day as it appears in glory;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|3|By (the mystery of) the creation of male and female;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|4|Verily,(the ends) ye strive for are diverse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|5|So he who gives (in charity) and fears (Allah),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|6|And (in all sincerity) testifies to the best,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|7|We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|8|But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|9|And gives the lie to the best,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|10|We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|11|Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong (into the Pit).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|12|Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|13|And verily unto Us (belong) the End and the Beginning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|14|Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|15|None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|16|Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|17|But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|18|Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|19|And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected in return,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|20|But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92|21|And soon will they attain (complete) satisfaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|1|By the Glorious Morning Light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|2|And by the Night when it is still,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|3|Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee,nor is He displeased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|4|And verily the Hereafter will be better for thee than the present.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|5|And soon will thy Guardian-Lord give thee (that wherewith) thou shalt be well-pleased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|6|Did He not find thee an orphan and give thee shelter (and care)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|7|And He found thee wandering,and He gave thee guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|8|And He found thee in need,and made thee independent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|9|Therefore,treat not the orphan with harshness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|10|Nor repulse the petitioner (unheard);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93|11|But the bounty of the Lord - rehearse and proclaim!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|1|Have We not expanded thee thy breast?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|2|And removed from thee thy burden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|3|The which did gall thy back?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|4|And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|5|So,verily,with every difficulty,there is relief:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|6|Verily,with every difficulty there is relief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|7|Therefore,when thou art free (from thine immediate task),still labour hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94|8|And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|1|By the Fig and the Olive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|2|And the Mount of Sinai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|3|And this City of security,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|4|We have indeed created man in the best of moulds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|5|Then do We abase him (to be) the lowest of the low,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|6|Except such as believe and do righteous deeds: For they shall have a reward unfailing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|7|Then what can,after this,contradict thee,as to the judgment (to come)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95|8|Is not Allah the wisest of judges?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|1|Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher,Who created-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|2|Created man,out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|3|Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|4|He Who taught (the use of) the pen,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|5|Taught man that which he knew not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|6|Day,but man doth transgress all bounds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|7|In that he looketh upon himself as self-sufficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|8|Verily,to thy Lord is the return (of all).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|9|Seest thou one who forbids-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|10|A votary when he (turns) to pray?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|11|Seest thou if he is on (the road of) Guidance?-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|12|Or enjoins Righteousness?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|13|Seest thou if he denies (Truth) and turns away?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|14|Knoweth he not that Allah doth see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|15|Let him beware! If he desist not,We will drag him by the forelock,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|16|A lying,sinful forelock!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|17|Then,let him call (for help) to his council (of comrades):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|18|We will call on the angels of punishment (to deal with him)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96|19|Day,heed him not: But bow down in adoration,and bring thyself the closer (to Allah)!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97|1|We have indeed revealed this (Message) in the Night of Power:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97|2|And what will explain to thee what the night of power is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97|3|The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97|4|Therein come down the angels and the Spirit by Allah´s permission,on every errand:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97|5|Peace!...This until the rise of morn!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|1|Those who reject (Truth),among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists,were not going to depart (from their ways) until there should come to them Clear Evidence,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|2|An messenger from Allah,rehearsing scriptures kept pure and holy:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|3|Wherein are laws (or decrees) right and straight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|4|Nor did the People of the Book make schisms,until after there came to them Clear Evidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|5|And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allah,offering Him sincere devotion,being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer; and to practise regular charity; and that is the Religion Right and Straight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|6|Those who reject (Truth),among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists,will be in Hell-Fire,to dwell therein (for aye). They are the worst of creatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|7|Those who have faith and do righteous deeds,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98|8|Their reward is with Allah: Gardens of Eternity,beneath which rivers flow; they will dwell therein for ever; Allah well pleased with them,and they with Him: all this for such as fear their Lord and Cherisher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|1|When the earth is shaken to her (utmost) convulsion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|2|And the earth throws up her burdens (from within),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|3|And man cries (distressed): ´What is the matter with her?´-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|4|On that Day will she declare her tidings:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|5|For that thy Lord will have given her inspiration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|6|On that Day will men proceed in companies sorted out,to be shown the deeds that they (had done).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|7|Then shall anyone who has done an atom´s weight of good,see it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99|8|And anyone who has done an atom´s weight of evil,shall see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|1|By the (Steeds) that run,with panting (breath),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|2|And strike sparks of fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|3|And push home the charge in the morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|4|And raise the dust in clouds the while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|5|And penetrate forthwith into the midst (of the foe) en masse;-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|6|Truly man is,to his Lord,ungrateful;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|7|And to that (fact) he bears witness (by his deeds);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|8|And violent is he in his love of wealth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|9|Does he not know,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|10|And that which is (locked up) in (human) breasts is made manifest-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100|11|That their Lord had been Well-acquainted with them,(even to) that Day?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|1|The (Day) of Noise and Clamour:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|2|What is the (Day) of Noise and Clamour?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|3|And what will explain to thee what the (Day) of Noise and Clamour is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|4|(It is) a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|5|And the mountains will be like carded wool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|6|Then,he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|7|Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|8|But he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) light,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|9|Will have his home in a (bottomless) Pit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|10|And what will explain to thee what this is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101|11|(It is) a Fire Blazing fiercely!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102|1|The mutual rivalry for piling up (the good things of this world) diverts you (from the more serious things),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

102|6|Ye shall certainly see Hell-Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102|7|Again,ye shall see it with certainty of sight!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102|8|Then,shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in!).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103|1|By (the Token of) Time (through the ages),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103|2|Verily Man is in loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

104|4|By no means! He will be sure to be thrown into That which Breaks to Pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104|5|And what will explain to thee That which Breaks to Pieces?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104|6|(It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104|7|The which doth mount (Right) to the Hearts:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104|8|It shall be made into a vault over them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104|9|In columns outstretched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105|1|Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105|2|Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105|3|And He sent against them Flights of Birds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105|4|Striking them with stones of baked clay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105|5|Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw,(of which the corn) has been eaten up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106|1|For the covenants (of security and safeguard enjoyed) by the Quraish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106|2|Their covenants (covering) journeys by winter and summer,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106|3|Let them adore the Lord of this House,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
